# Colorado Coal Project
## Description

The Colorado Coal Project documents the history of coal mining in the Western US from immigration and daily life in the coal camps to labor conditions and strikes, including Ludlow (1913-1914) and Columbine (1927).

The collection was put together by Eric Margolis and Ronald McMahan while they were graduate students at the University of Colorado Boulder in the 1970’s. To learn more about their biographies and the collection visit the [Colorado Coal Project Papers]( https://archives.colorado.edu/repositories/2/resources/976) ArchivesSpace page. 

The collection was digitized and published around 2012-2014. Legacy metadata came directly from index cards Eric and Ronald had created for each item in the collection. 
In 2020-2021 the legacy metadata was edited and re-formatted to conform to current standards in cataloging. New metadata was also added to describe each item in more detail and increase discoverability. The legacy metadata and current metadata can be found within the "metadata" folder on this page.

## Metadata

### Collection Name
Colorado Coal Project

### Title
Legacy titles have been changed or expanded/edited to accurately describe the item and help with discoverability.

### Creator
Creators have been added on photographs where the original item and metadata can be found and confirmed at the organization that holds the original copy. Many of the interviews and photographs done by Eric Margolis and Ronald McMahan did not list them as creators. Their names have been added to many more items original to the Colorado Coal Project. URIs have also been added for controlled names.

### Subject
Subject headings have been added or edited to accurately describe the item and help with discoverability. URIs from FAST have also been added if the heading was a controlled term. 
### Description
Descriptions have been cleaned up for spelling/grammar mistakes, and in many cases expanded upon to accurately describe the item and help with discoverability. Also, many items have an extended description field that informs the user that the item they are looking at is a copy of an original item and continues to state from what institution’s collections the original item and metadata can be found at if more information is needed.
### Publisher
University of Colorado Boulder Archives
### Contributor
Names of retired miners and their families have been entered into the contributor field if they participated in an interview for the Colorado Coal Project.
### Date
Dates have been changed to conform to ISO 8601 standard. Many dates have been added to items where the organization that holds the original item and metadata confirmed the date. The date “[1970s]” was added to many interviews and photographs missing a date and was created by Eric Margolis and Ronald McMahan for the Colorado Coal Project
### Type
Type terms were changed to the Library of Congress’ “Resource Types Scheme” terminology. The terms used include Moving image, Still image, Text, and Audio.
### Format
Format was changed to [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) (IANA) media formats. Formats seen throughout the Colorado Coal Project are: image/tiff, video/mov, application/pdf and audio/mp3.
### Identifier
All identifiers in the metadata have been edited to match the media file name exactly as it appears including spaces, characters, and the file extension. Old identifiers can be found on legacy metadata sheets.
### Source
Colorado Coal Project Collection
### Language
“English” added to items such as interviews and transcripts.
### Relation
Records with a related item have been changed to state the title of the related item.
### Relation Type
Records with a related item have been changed to state a controlled heading according to the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) [RDF Schema Declaration of Relation Types](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/rdf-relation-types/). Frequently used types include: isPartOf, isFormatOf, references, and isVersionOf.
### Relation href
Records with a related item have been changed to state the related item’s identifier and/or archival resource key (ARK).
### Coverage Spatial
Coverage terms have been edited or added to accurately describe location and help with discoverability. Most of the coverage terms come from the United States [Geographic Names Information System](https://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=138:1:::NO::P1_COUNTY,P1_COUNTY_ALONG:n,) (GNIS) gazetteer. Coverage terms have been locally formatted with granularity in mind to help identify the location of obscure places like mines, ghost towns, and rural mining towns. Coverage is constructed as: “Place (City, County, State, Country, Continent) (feature type)”
### Coverage Temporal
A range of dates regarding the timeframe the object is based from or about.
### Rights
Rights statements have been changed to conform to [rightsstatements.org](https://rightsstatements.org/page/1.0/?language=en) copyright statements.

## Resources
Many of the photographs in this collection are copies of original items. While reformatting the new metadata in 2020 an attempt was made to record the institution that owns the original item so that researchers can look at their metadata or find similar items. If an original item was located the organization was recored within an extended description field in the metadata. A list is provided below with the names of organizations that items in the Colorado Coal Project came from.
