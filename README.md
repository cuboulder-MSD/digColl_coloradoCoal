## Notes

This collection was curated by two PhD students in the 1970s. The students created their own interviews, photographs and documentation in order to gather information about the history and culture of mining in the Western United States. They also collected historical photographs and records related to mining in order to expand the content of the collection. Therefore, much of the collection is made up of photographs of items taken from external resources or archival collections the University of Colorado Boulder does not own. For example, much of the images in the collection are black-and-white photographs of figures within books. 

The identifiers in the metadata were assigned by the students in the 1970s and consist of acronyms and a numbering sequence which indicate where the item was borrowed from; however, we have only been able to decipher a few of the acronyms seen throughout the metadata. Here is the current list of acronyms and their phrases.
