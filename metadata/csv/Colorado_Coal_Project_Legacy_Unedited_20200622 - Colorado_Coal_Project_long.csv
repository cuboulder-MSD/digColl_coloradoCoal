(Lindley Miller), 1864-1932","Holbrook, Williard (Major)",,,,,,"""This paper was originally presented as 'The Governor, The Secretary of War, and the Colorado Coal Strike of 1914' at … the 1976 Western History Association Annual Conference, … [in] Denver, Colorado."" It gives an account of the time after the Ludlow Massacre when the Governor of Colorado was unable to restore peace to mining towns and he reluctantly asked federal troops for help. The deployment was managed directly by the Secretary of War, Lindley Garrison, and handled locally by Major Williard Holbrook. Soldiers closed saloons and gun shops, disarmed both the striking miners and some of the police, and guarded mining towns. They remained entirely neutral, President Wilson stressing that Colorado needed to resolve the actual labor issues itself. The occupation, which lasted until January 1915, is portrayed as a rare but necessary means to quell ""domestic violence.""",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,"Albright, Joan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1976,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transAlbright,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Trinidad, CO",,Colorado,"Ludlow, CO",,,,,,,,1914,,,,,,,,,albright_a_m1,,,,

Mr. Pazar's family came to Huerfano County about 1908-1917. They homesteaded but returned to coal mining. Early miners worked long hours, 7 days a week. Boys would work in the mines with their fathers. Pres. Wilson instituted shorter workdays. The coal camps included many small stores, which have become centralized over time. Store owners had to extend credit to encourage trade and began to encounter more crime. During the 1913/1914 strike, their families were mining and homesteading, not running stores. They also recall the IWW (""Wobblies"") strike in the 1920s. Afterwards, homes and businesses began to transition from coal to gas for heat. Alber was in Toltec during the strike; he recalls the influx of armed strangers and the militia. Emma's family was in Rouse during the 1913 strike; they moved out, to homestead on Bear Creek. Many miners commuted to the mine from farms and ranches, coming home only on weekends. To ""prove up"" their homestead, they'd have to till some new land each season, for 3 years. They recall when there were more than 17,000 miners in Huerfano and Las Animas counties.

He describes it as a self-contained ""company owned camp"". Workers were paid in script and shopped at the company store. He describes 16-hour work-days, black lung (which was then known as ""miner's asthma""), and no compensation for injuries. Still, he felt his employer was better than most coal mines in the state. The workforce (which included many ethnic groups) had no machines, only picks. They had no check weighman, to validate their coal output. During the Depression (1933), they were finally able to unionize with little trouble and could finally raise safety concerns with impunity. He is upset with recent efforts at a right-to-work law. He recalls organizing Hispanic miners in New Mexico, just before they were called to active duty in the National Guard. Early mining was more physically demanding, and there were few options to a company town and store. Underground mining has become more technical, specialized, and pay is based on hourly rates (not the tonnage produced). He describes John R. Lawson, a UMW district president in 1913/14, who was shot during a strike, but later became president of Rocky Mountain Fuel Company -- Josephine Roach had controlling interest; the union lent the company money, to keep miners working. The company then signed UMW contracts. John L. Lewis sent Stucker to organize the union (UMWA). The Ludlow strike (which eventually required intervention by the regular army) broke the union in that area. By contrast, in western Colorado Stucker never saw a gun ""in the hands of the company or the men"". From about 1936-1946, Stucker worked in New Mexico, where mines were mostly non-union. John L. Lewis sent him after the failure of the 1933 strike by the National Miners' Union -- which failed to get a contract and (Stucker claims) was dominated by communists. Despite initial resistance, he eventually organized all the miners in the area. Stucker now sees an effort to destroy the UMWA. [Moose] had some organizer's training back east; he comes from a mining family on both sides. His disability is due to back injury from Thomson Creek and from black lung. The company would lay off and avoid hiring ""undesirable"" union activists; similarly, the company would alter work assignments to favor employees they liked. Moose started mining in 1947, at the age of 18, after 3 years in the navy. Stucker describes the Taft-Hartley injunction being used against the UMWA in the mid-1940s. Soon, the railroads switched from coal to oil, further threatening the coal industry. Miners instituted a 3-day workweek in July 1949, which helped deplete coal stockpiles; in March 1950, miners went on strike. The govt. invoked the Taft-Hartley law (which the union ignored), levied fines upon the union and its president, and nationalized the mine. Eventually, all parties signed a good contract. Both Moose and Stucker agree that current wages are good but that recent contracts have reduced benefits. They discuss the 1917 strike at Kebler Mine, Colorado, between UMWA and Rocky Mountain Fuel. The UMWA formed a corporation (Lou Merkin Company) to operate union mines. After the 1950 contract, the union worked toward a nation-wide agreement. Stucker organized in New Mexico among Hispanic and Navajo miners, who were often treated even worse than their Anglo counterparts. By the mid-1930s, he succeeded in signing contracts for these miners but was later attacked by company goons at a Labor Day party. Similarly, in 1973 Moose was arrested while picketing in Wyoming, handcuffed and jailed. Stucker organized in Madrid, New Mexico, where Appalachian subcontractors opposed unionization. The union struck for 16 weeks, beginning 1 April 1941; the picket line became a violent confrontation. Silver Lorenzo assisted in the organizing effort. They discuss the compensation for black lung disease, which took so long to pass that many benefits went to widows: the miners themselves had died. Stucker recalls John L. Lewis, his skill as a union organizer, even his work as a coal miner. Stucker speaks of the current strike and feels it could have a positive outcome, unifying the union. The organizers now encounter larger corporations that hope to standardize contracts by driving them down in cost, not up. The miners express concern about new coal fields and oil shale deposits, especially their effects on the way of life in nearby towns and farms.",summary,"Miner Yvonne Biggs talks about her recent hand injury, which happened at the non-union Westmoreland mine and led to a worker's compensation dispute. The conversation includes former safety officer at the mine, Jerry Diaz. Yvonne joined the union hoping for some sort of job protection. She thinks a union mine would be a safer workplace, with more emphasis on safety and less on production. She was unable to get a safety committee hearing after her accident.

Lewis). Disputes between union membership and leaders are aired. One interviewee is a woman miner, who presents difficulties in driving some equipment for which she seems too short. She reports getting mixed reactions when she first started mining, but also that older miners have been very patient in teaching her the craft. Another miner relates good times at Somerset, where all the miners helped each other (regardless of nationality). (transcripts of news broadcasts (Ed Bradley and Barry Sarafin, CBS News)): Miners are ordered to return to work for an 80-day cooling off period. Quoting Pres. Carter: the Taft-Hartley Act is to be enforced. At least some mining must resume so as to prevent a national crisis; pickets will be barred and facilities will be guarded (if necessary, by the National Guard). Attorney-General Griffin Bell requested and was granted a temporary restraining order to end the strike. A hearing to request a Taft-Hartley injunction will be scheduled for next week. (returning to picket line interviews): We hear recollections of childhood life in the tent colony at the Somerset Mine. Shorty Hunter discusses photos of the start of the Somerset coal camp (1902-): workers lived in a tent colony until houses were built in 1904; they began work with oil lamps, pick & shovel mining. His mother was the first woman in the camp, and his father died in 1915. Coal mining was usually seasonal, with only 1-2 days of work per week in the summer.

He tells anecdotes about the pranks that the miners would pull on one another, and mentions the variety in immigrants that worked in the mines-Greeks, Austrians, and others. Bruger also tells his take on the companies that were the big players in his time : Rocky Mountain Fuel Company and Standard, and what happened when the United Mine Workers of America union and the ""Wobblies"" (Industrial Workers of the World), came into the equation. He tells about what was happening in the company when it was run by John Roche, and the changes that Josephine Roche put into play. He talks about strike conditions, how some mines put in machine guns, and how they hired scabs to do the work when the miners refused to work.",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,"Bruger, Louis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Text,text/pdf,Louis Bruger,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lafayette, CO","Monarch Mine, CO","Columbine Mine, CO","Frederick, CO",,,"Morrison Mine, CO","Simpson Mine, CO",,,,1908/1984,,,,,,,,CLF-No video found to accompany transcripts.,,,,,

Later the Huerfano Agency Company sold coal to state institutions and neighboring states. His son, George, was made General Manager of the Operation of Mines. He was still young and learned on the job, travelling to mines, talking with miners, and transporting payroll. The mining business collapsed as natural gas became preferred and rail rates went up.

Guigli's Italian immigrant mother came from a family of Polenta famers and sheep herders. John Guigli, his father, came to the U.S. to be a miner, and sent for his children and wife after establishing himself, but an accident befell him and he died shortly thereafter, leaving his wife a widow alone in a mining town. According to Louis Guigli, his mother (who goes unnamed), was widowed several times in her marriages to miners, trying to make ends meet by running a boarding house in the mining community. Guigli discusses the strong Catholic presence in the mining camps, and recreational activities, which included sports and ""boccis"". Guigli asserts that the camp was full of moonshiners, and agents would come take samples of the wines and beers made by the moonshiners in the towns and then leave them alone for the year-but one year a bachelor told the agents that he wasn't giving them free whiskey anymore, and there was a confrontation during which two agents were shot. The police came after the moonshiner and he shot himself rather than go to jail. Guigli describes his family's farming efforts to fight the poverty and hunger that befell them when they found themselves without a father or stepfather's mining income to help them along. Guigli's home was within range of the machine guns at the mine during the strike, and his family spent multiple days hiding in the cellar, eating apples and waiting for the shots to stop. Company doctors treated the miners and their families, but Guigli asserted that his mother used natural remedies to treat ailments, including tying garlic around the necks of everyone in the family to prevent the flu. When he needed money badly, Guigli sold newspapers, one of which was the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) newspaper-but one day he saw a man shot while distributing papers and he ran off and never sold those papers again.

Phelps and his patients,,,"Margolis, Eric, 1947-",,,"McMahan, Ronald L.",,,,,,,,Coal mines and mining,United States -- Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969,United States -- Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972,Lungs -- Dust diseases -- Colorado,Coal mining -- Colorado,,Silicosis -- Colorado,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The interviewee (a physician, working in Pueblo) discusses symptoms of pneumoconiosis (black lung disease) in coal miners. X-ray results in western miners are more diffuse than in eastern miners of anthracite coal and usually lead to a negative result. Pulmonary function / ventilation tests are often normal (in non-smoking miners). Further testing of arterial blood gases shows only a small percentage of oxygen is being extracted from the lungs into the blood. Without treatment, affected individuals often die of heart failure. Dr. Phelps claims the disease in Colorado is mostly one of silicosis, due to drilling or grinding hard rock. X-ray anomalies seen at sea level are rarely seen in miners in Colorado. The legal standards for mining disability conflict with evidence seen in Colorado coal miners. ""…at the time we did the studies not a single coal miner in the history of Colorado had ever been compensated for pnuemoconiosis."" Colorado miners usually had no chronic bronchitis and could ventilate well. Dr. Phelps evaluated patients on the basis of a disability table for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. He describes the treadmill test and measure of minute ventilation. The test is contraindicated for patients with chest pain, an abnormal electrocardiogram, or other cardiac risk factors. The ventilatory test does not apply to non-smoking individuals in the mountain West, who are hyperventilating already. And X-rays alone will not accurately diagnose affected coal miners in the mountain West. Miners with silicosis do not tend to become progressively worse, if they leave the mines. They may have a normal life span but cannot work the last 20-30 years of their lives. The original Federal laws focused on relief to Appalachian miners but ignored the needs of those in the mountain West. The black lung program was underfunded and based on a low estimate of the number of coal miners involved. Inaccurate testing and arbitrary standards for disability pitted former miners against each other. The process further divides patients from their doctors, who are seen as agents of the regulatory regime. (The questions for physicians were lifted verbatim from the British Medical Research Council chronic bronchitis questionnaire.) It may have been more fair to make a blanket, modest award to all coal miners, rather than to force individuals into an adversarial claim system. Insufficient research has been done on effects of mining at high altitudes. In compensation cases, arterial blood gases were not evaluated until after 1968. Bureaucrats in Baltimore and in Trinidad, Colorado have been indifferent or even hostile to the coal miners. The miners did not ask for the compensation plan, and it too often disappoints and embitters them. Several miners are examined by Dr. Phelps: Mr. Guterrez [sp? Gutierrez?] worked 21 years, quitting in 1960 when the Valdez mine closed. In 1970, he applied under Federal black lung law: a long time after traveling to various sites for tests and exams, his claim was denied and he was forced to take even more tests and exams. After denial of a claim, a patient can file an appeal with Social Security to examine his records; to hire a lawyer will drain the patient of even more resources. Joaquin Trujillo, from Trinidad, applied for Federal benefits in 1970 after working 24 years in the mines, including the Valdez. Another miner, 55-years old, worked 25 years in 5 coal mines, quit working in 1959. On a treadmill exercise test, his disability becomes evident. ""…a drop in P02 on exercise is probably the earliest sign that this individual is beginning to have difficulty."" Albert Noga, of Walsenburg, was a miner for at least 25 years. Many miners have no proof on additional work, in smaller mines: Albert may have worked 34 years in total. Another miner is still waiting for a decision on his black lung claim, 5 years after filing it. Dr. Phelps describes Congressional hearings including Sen. Gary Hart, at which he hopes to testify. Another miner relates 30 years of work in the mines, including roof bolting (which is especially dangerous because they're drilling hard rock). ""…they're actually developing hard rock silicosis by the miner grinding hard rock.""",,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,"Guterrez, Mr.","Noga, Albert",,"Phelps, Harvey W., M.D.","Trujillo, Joaquin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transPhelps,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He mentions the Rapson mine and the Robinson mine at Walsenburg -- where all the miners were black. Willard White was a miner there. Many blacks were brought in to work during strikes. At Farr, Colo., the Camera mine was named after Sheriff Jeff Farr. The company seized Mike, brought him before Farr, who claimed to be the ""king of the county"". The sheriff told Mike he wouldn't be permitted to do his ""dirty work"" in his county. Mike and Kate view a photo of a company store and conclude it must have been a posed shot: Kate says the women were too well dressed for miners' wives. Talk turns to the IWW 1927 strike, led by the ""Wobblies"" (the IWW). In Trinidad, Colo. the ""Rangers"" were were called out for the '27 strike. The sheriff asked Mike to vouch for inmates before they were released. The '27 strike won a $1 wage increase. The UMWA lacked organizers in the mines at the time. Mike and Kate felt the photos were mostly showing the CF&I viewpoint. Kate remarks that little historical data was preserved -- working people were too busy. Kate's father emphasized education for his children. He was a German-speaking immigrant from the Austrian Tyrol and mined in the Pennsylvanian German colony. Kate was born in Marshall. Her dad ""opened"" mines, was a union supporter, and moved to Trinidad after he left mining. Kate worked in the Trinidad telephone office in 1913. She married Mike in '17: he went back east to organize steel mill workers and to Canada as a union organizer. She recalls women marching in the Trinidad street during strike; the phone employees had to stay at work overnight -- it was thought too dangerous to go outside. Mother Jones putting her hands over the militia's gun, shouting ""You go ahead and shoot, you SOBs, if you want to kill some of our women and children."" When Belcher was shot, the phones were busy. Kate's father donated his personal guns to the union cause. She adds, ""When I speak, sometimes I interrupt, it's because I was there."" Kate's first conversation with Mike was when she helped him place a call. The operators heard much of the conversations; they supported and gave preference to the miners. Mother Jones was kidnapped off the train at Trinidad and forced to go to the San Rafael hospital. She didn't especially like other women; she enjoyed a beer and was ""a woman among men""; she spoke from Mother Jones's Hill. When women marched in Trinidad, the militia rode among them. Mother Jones put her hands over their machine guns and dared them to shoot. Kate calls it ""a war right in Trinidad""; she was on duty when Belcher was killed. Chase led the militia, but women marchers continued their efforts. Kate believes the mining camps used to be livelier: camps used to sponsor baseball games and there were no ethnic or racial tensions. The camps had picnics and parades. When she was a girl, she recalls a flatbed truck with food, dancing, and lots of good times -- happy times. The camps had gardens.",summary,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,"Livoda, Kate",,,,,,,,,"Livoda, Mike, 1886-1984",,,,,,,,,1978-06,sound,audio/mp3,15-94_Livoda,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda3,derivedFrom,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/rvu9l7,15-96_Livoda,relatedTo,???????????????,15-95B_Livoda,relatedTo,???????????????,15-95A_Livoda,relatedTo,???????????????,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Trinidad, CO","Walsenburg, CO","Huerfano County, CO","Las Animas County, CO",,,,,,,,1907/1980,,,,,,,,"15-94_Livoda audio (length =00:30:29) represents the middle part of the 3rd Livoda transcript ""Interview with Mike Livoda (part 3 of 4), including his wife, Kate "".

He started work at steel mills in Steubenville, Ohio: 12 hours/day for $1.75. He left to prospect in Alaska, but only got as far as Butte, Montana. He began coal mining: liked the work and the people (many different nationalities who all got along). He moved to Colorado: despite state law limiting work day to 8 hours, coal companies demanded 10. The company wouldn't permit the miners to hire a checkweighman, to verify the weight of their coal. Also, the companies didn't pay miners for non-production work: for timbering, or ""narrow work"". In southern Colorado, Bob Ulich got Mike to work for UMWA and to organize a miners' union; by 1912, there were ~ 8,000 miners working in the canyons near Ludlow. He was forced out of Walsenburg by Sheriff Jeff Farr and beaten; Livoda called deputy Shorty Martinez the ""stooge of the sheriff"" (tho Shorty later joined the union cause). Livoda discusses the 1913/1914 strike: In preparation, the miners met in convention -- concluded the company would not negotiate with them -- and set the date for strike as 23 Sept. 1913. The company kicked the miners out of company housing and the snow began to fall. About 1500 people were living in tents at Ludlow, with others at Aguilar and Walsenburg. Each tent colony was managed by a committee; at Ludlow, Diamond and Louis Tikas were considered leaders. Mike traveled from one tent colony to another, trying to keep spirits up. The different ethnic groups in the tent colonies got along well. Livoda worked during the strike with Mother Jones, who was already an old woman -- but was quickly revived and ready for more speeches after a bottle of beer. Mother Jones was arrested and confined in the Mt. San Rafael Hospital in Trinidad; strikers marched in her support but were met by opponents on horseback. (As an aside, Livoda does not favor women working in the mines today.) On 11 April 1914, Lippiet was killed in nearby Trinidad by Belcher (who was later shot and killed, despite the steel vest he wore). Belcher was supposedly shot by Louis Zancanelli (tho A. B. McGarry and Sam Carter were also involved, to some extent). ML helped these 2 to escape. (Zancanelli was later jailed for almost 3 years and then tried, which resulted in a hung jury.) The strikers and the militia were on opposite sides of the C & S railroad track. Livoda claims that the National Guardsmen were often former company guards; he calls Linderfelt ""… a son of a bitch"". On 20 April 1914 (Greek Easter Sunday), Tikas went to the militia to talk and was killed. When fighting in Ludlow started, Livoda and John Lawson jumped into a car and headed to the colony. They couldn't get past the surrounding guards. Lawson went on to Aguilar. For about a week Mike was about 1.5 mile outside the cordon, waiting with a rifle for a chance to storm the guards. They didn't know the number of casualties for 1-2 weeks after the massacre. They view and discuss photos of Gen. ""Jeb"" Chase, commander of the National Guard and of the ""death special"", a vehicle mounted with a machine gun. (Mrs. Kate Livoda joins the interview; the couple married 63 years ago, in 1917.) At the turn of century, Trinidad catered to the miners who came into town on Saturday night. Kate recalls a rough childhood: other kids -- and even teachers -- looked down on miners' children; they had to get by on cheap food and poor housing. Life in the coal camps was tough: outhouses, hauling water, walking several miles to school; the superintendent's children would get the front seats in the company school; the miners were paid in script and had to shop at the company store. As a child, Kate lived in the coal camps in Tercio and Primrose. When work ceased, they'd have to travel in the caboose between camps. They couldn't afford to buy coal, so they would pick it from the RR tracks. Her father was blackballed from the mines because of his speeches supporting better working conditions, so they moved into Trinidad. She was working for the telephone company in 1913, when she met Mike Livoda. Kate recalls the ""women's march"" in Trinidad; Kate was on the post-office steps (near her workplace) during the women's march. Mother Jones was detained in the hospital; women supporters of the strikers marched to it, and she was released. Mother Jones forced the opponents to remove a machine gun atop the First National Bank at the corner of Main and Commercial Streets, in the center of Trinidad. Kate didn't feel that Mother Jones cared much for the miners' women; she was tiny, but had a strong voice; she was intelligent, but profane -- and she enjoyed a bottle of beer after her speech. The phone company was swamped when Belcher was killed, and Livoda was insisting that she put thru his call. Kate was also working when Lippiet (a union organizer) was killed. When the 1913 strike began, she was a long distance operator; lines were busy with calls from the Pinkerton group and from the strike supporters. The townspeople generally supported the union and donated ammunition for the strikers. Louis Tikas approached to militia to parley about protection for the women and children -- when he was killed. Most of the militiamen left the area after the massacre; public sentiment was strongly against them. (Mike Livoda returns to the interview.) At the time of the 1913/1914 strike, he describes local officials in Las Animas and Huerfano counties as ""…tools of the coal corporation"". Miners wanted better working conditions: an honest checkweighman, 8-hour work-days, and the right to shop elsewhere than the company store. Strikers got $3/week strike pay (and $1/week for their wife and 50 cents per child per week). During the strike, families helped each other and the union provided some health care. Mike recalls that on Greek Easter Sunday (20 April 1914), trouble started when National Guardsmen insulted strikers' wives. Afterwards, Mike and others were hiding in the hills, until the Federal troops arrived. Livoda kept his rifle; most others turned theirs in to the Federal troops. After the massacre, the union rebuilt the tent colony at Ludlow; nearby farmers provided the strikers with food. The couple recollect Glenn Altman, a photographer in Trinidad. Years after the strike, there were still differences and hard feelings in the town between miners and other residents. They talk about changes in the old coal communities: some now with only retired miners; one camp near Cokedale lies under the water of a newly-built dam; other people have begun to use oil or natural gas for fuel. At Tercio, the only thing left is the building of the old company store. Mike distinguishes between domestic and coking coal: from Aguilar north, the coal couldn't be used to make coke; from Aguilar south into New Mexico were found deposits of coking coal. The Allen mine now employs about 300, mostly young Hispanic miners. When mining work became scarce, ML worked running the CCC camps near Walden and Craig, Colo. Livoda recalls his night-time beating in Ravenwood, by American Fuel Co. men and the sheriff. They found him hiding in a miner's house. Afterwards, for 4 days he hid in a Walsenburg shack, near the tailor's shop and the Polish Hall. The sheriff of Huerfano County, Jeff Farr, had declared himself ""king of the county"" and tried to run Livoda out of Walsenburg. During the ""Ten Days' War"" (after the Ludlow massacre), John Lawson sent Livoda to organize fighters to take over Ludlow and other sites, such as Aguilar and Trinidad. They attacked the Southwestern and Jewel mines (also Rugby, Primrose, and Rauss). The striking miners burned some coal tipples (and may have killed some mine mules). Afterwards, Livoda went to the Black Hills to work as an organizer there. The interviewer gets the couple to sing ""Union Forever"". Mike reflects on his long life: despite the struggles, he always thought they would eventually win. Tho he didn't consider himself well-educated, he did try to help organize workers for more pay. They discuss a photo showing UMWA organizers: Bill Diamond, Bob Ulich, and Mike Livoda. They discuss Joe and Emma Zanetell, who during the strike were in the tent colony at Forbes. At the time, she gave birth to stillborn twins; the colony went to Trinidad for the burial -- in their absence, the militia attacked and destroyed the tents.",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,"Livoda, Kate","Livoda, Mike",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9/20/1980,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda2,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda3,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/13ae6y,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda4,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/6qta56,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda1,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/rohcy8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Walsenburg, CO",,"Ludlow, CO","Trinidad, CO",,,,,,,,1907/1980,,,,,,,,JZ,,,,,

He also talks about Barron Beshoar (author of ""Out of the Depths"" and son of local doctor). Prior to the strike, Huerfano County Sheriff Jeff Farr swore in 259 deputies (paid by the operators). Livoda claims that Farr was illegally elected, with even non-citizens voting for him. (Farr died about a year after the massacre; CF&I later named a camp for Sheriff Farr, at the Cameron mine.) Mother Jones came to speak ~15 Sept., 1913 -- before the strike began. Livoda reads the 1913 list of 7 demands on the ""strike call""; these were unanimously approved by the convention. Coal company operators (Rocky Mountain Fuel, CF&I, and Victor American Fuel Co.) were given 48 hours to consider, but they refused to negotiate at all. Livoda was elected vice-president of the union district, during the strike. On 23 Sept. 1913, he, John Lawson, Bernardo Verna, and another were at Ludlow when striking families began to arrive after eviction from company housing -- as it began to snow heavily. The coal operators had coerced the railroads, which failed to deliver tents for about 1200-1500 people. Other tent colonies were at Aguilar, Walsenburg, Sopris, Forbes, and eventually Trinidad. The miners and union bought guns for self-protection. In order to save money, the operators wanted the state to send in the militia (who arrived on 28 Oct. 1913). Gen. Chase was in charge. Eventually, the original guardsmen were mustered out and often replaced by company guards who enlisted. Livoda declares, ""Linderfelt was the biggest murderer that ever lived."" Additional guardsmen would approach Ludlow by train; the strikers had been warned and would take positions to keep the troops at a distance from the tent colony. Mike Livoda describes the ""death special"" armored car, which fired into the tent colonies (including killing a boy at Forbes). During the women's march in Trinidad, they marched on the hospital to free Mother Jones from detention there. Livoda was watching on the post office steps, when the militia on horseback ran into the marchers. He speaks about ""Don"", a reporter for the Denver Express (which gave fair coverage to the strikers). Livoda felt that the Denver Post, Rocky Mountain News, Chronicle News, and the Picket Wire were biased in favor of the operators. Strikers bought the Trinidad Free Press. On 10 March 1914, the tent colony at Forbes was burned. Livoda talks about Louis Tikas: after fighting began at Ludlow, Tikas crossed to negotiate with the militia, was hit over the head and killed. Livoda says Linderfelt broke a gun over Louis's head. Mike Livoda and Lawson received a phone call that fighting had erupted at Ludlow; they sped out there in a car; Livoda got out at Suffield, trying to round up guns and men. During ""the 10-days war"", he organized about 450 men to stay in the area (tho Ludlow was already destroyed by that time); the men in the field had no hot food or even coffee, as they didn't dare start a fire. After the Ludlow massacre, at Forbes tent colony, the strikers ""…started to get even"", before the Federal troops arrived. Livoda sent about 175 men from Trinidad with orders to confront miners breaking the strike -- but to leave women and children alone. He saw the Ludlow efforts as part of a larger, nationwide movement to improve life for workers. They talk about several individuals active in the local and national labor struggles. After WWI, Livoda was sent to Youngstown, Ohio to help organize steelworkers there. (Mrs. Kate Livoda joins in.) If the American miners were restless and making demands, coal companies would import new immigrants as strikebreakers. Companies would also recruit foreigners as saloon keepers. Mike credits John L. Lewis and the CIO with organizing labor across craft lines, so they were more unified. He sees Nelson Rockefeller (then Vice-President of the U. S., under Gerald Ford) as a different sort of man than his earlier relatives. Discussing black lung, Livoda feels that these problems need legislative action and that labor needs to make the case to legislators. Mrs. Livoda adds that some miners with the disease haven't received benefits because they can't prove their work in the mines for a minimum period of time (usually 10-15 years). Mike didn't qualify for a miner's pension, tho he did receive one from the AFL-CIO; he was vice-president of the UMWA District 15 from 1914-1938. His work supervising a CCC camp ended with WWII. Mrs. L. connected him with Adolph Germer and a job with the CIO. Livoda describes strip mining and unions -- if organized at all, many chose craft unions such as mechanics. They may need better union organizers; it also helps to speak their language, if the miners are new immigrants. The couple discuss the experiences of immigrants to America, who have prospered and created higher qualities of life for their children. The immigrants may qualify for pensions and Social Security benefits. Mike feels that this country needs both workers and investors to create good jobs. The couple look at old pictures of Colorado coal towns. They mention that some black miners were brought in as strikebreakers, but later joined the union. During the 1927 IWW strike, Mike Livoda signed for arrested strikers to release them from jail (tho he was not part of that union).Kate Livoda's father immigrated from the Austrian Tyrol, spoke German, and mined in Pennsylvania and Colorado. By 1913, she was in Trinidad working for the telephone company. Since the militia were in the streets, women phone operators stayed in town in a boarding house: ""...we slept with our clothes on."" Mother Jones confronted the armed militia there: she placed her hand over their guns and dared them to shoot. Kate met Mike when helping him place a phone call, just after the shooting of Belcher. The authorities heard that Mother Jones was coming to Trinidad, grabbed her off the train and detained her in Mt. San Rafael Hospital. Kate recalls that Mother Jones would protect the rights of women and children, but would rather be with the men. Kate was at work when Lippiatt was shot in the street and when Belcher was later shot for that crime. She recalls earlier, happier times when the coal camps were active and people gathered for baseball games and holiday parties. She reads aloud a couple of excerpts from Mother Jones's speeches (one to striking miners, another to Gen. Chase, commander of the Colo. National Guard). Kate claims that the gun used to kill Belcher belonged to her boyfriend at the time. She also identifies the young man who brought torches to Ludlow to burn the tents as Chitsworth, a boss's son; he bragged about his role afterward. Mr. and Mrs. Livoda discuss the prelude to the Ludlow Massacre: by 19 April 1914, Hamrock was in the militia camp, and Linderfelt had brought in his men. Mike thinks the attack was planned. He reads the names of those who died during the Colorado Coal Strike. Kate Livoda speaks of the early miners and their families: ""… they just gave of themselves. They just gave of themselves.""",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,"Livoda, Kate","Livoda, Mike",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1978-06,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda3,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda2,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/0ozkwe,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda4,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/6qta56,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda1,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/rohcy8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Las Animas County, CO","Ludlow, CO","Aguilar, CO","Huerfano County, CO",,,"Trinidad, CO","Walsenburg, CO",,,,1887/1974,,,,,,,,JZ,,,,,

Mike Livoda came to the U.S. in 1904, from Austria-Hungary (now part of Yugoslavia); he had a 6th grade education in Europe. He started work in the steel mills in Steubenville, Ohio -- loading pig iron at night, 13 hour shifts, at age 16, for $1.75/day. He started mining coal in Red Lodge, Mont. in 1907: work was seasonal, so he moved on to Sheridan, Wyo. and to Denver in May, 1910. Coal miners in northern Colo. were out on strike about 1910-1913. Mike was working in a non-striking mine in Leiden: miners were cheated on their tonnage and got no payment for dead work. Working conditions in the coal mines violated the length of workday laws and the right to hire their own checkweighman. Livoda transferred to southern Colo. mines when the UMWA began organizing there in Jan. 1912. Robert Yulich of Trinidad had notified John Lawson that Livoda might be a good union organizer; Lawson approached Livoda to act as an organizer. He preferred to stay undercover working in the mines -- partly for his own safety (he was forced out of Walsenburg and beaten up in Ravenwood, Colo.). In 1912, he first organized the mine in Aguilar, CO -- which prompted 65 armed men to enter the town to investigate. The coal companies sent in men to try to run him out of town, but local people supported Livoda. He then organized in Trinidad, at Sopris, Piedmont and the Segundo. Miners often went out on strike before being organized as a union. To protect their jobs, Livoda recruited union members one-by-one and made them swear to secrecy -- not even to share the information with their wives. He often had to recruit after dark, hiding during the day to avoid jail and beatings. Livoda would meet sympathetic miners at fraternal lodges (e.g., Serb National Federation, Croatian Fraternal Union of America), weddings, funerals or other social events. He was influenced by the early labor leader Samuel Gompers. The union demanded reduction of hours from 10 to 8 per day, a raise from $2.95 to $3.15 (per day?), and an independently hired checkweighman. Miners were also striking for right to trade where they please -- not just at the company store. They also demanded the right to be paid every 2 weeks (not just once per month) and to be paid in cash, not in ""scrip"". The company exploited the local lawmen and the company store to keep miners in check: local authorities even coerced non-citizens to vote illegally for favored candidates in local elections. The coal company operators included Colorado Fuel and Iron Corporation, Victor American Fuel, and Rocky Mountain Fuel. Livoda calls the Victor American Fuel Company ""one of the bitterest company that we had to fight with in Colorado."" There were then about 10,000 miners in Las Animas and Huerfano counties of Colorado. Sheriff Jeff Farr ran Livoda out of Walsenburg for union organizing, but he returned and defied the sheriff. In 1913, miners voted to present demands to the ""operators"" and voted to go out on strike 23 Sept. 1913; it snowed hard in Ludlow that day. A tent colony was established for the striking miners and their families, who were thrown out of company housing -- about 1800 people. Aguilar had about 2000 people, both in tents and in non-company housing. There were also UMWA tent colonies at Suffield, Forbes, Aguilar, Rugby, Prior and Walsenburg, Colorado. The strikers included Mexicans, ""Spanish-Americans"", Scotch-English, Russians, Poles, Romanians, Serbs, Montenegrins, Italians, ""negroes"", Slovaks, and Czechs. Livoda noticed that different ethnic groups got along well when they were prospering, but tensions developed with economic struggles. He worked with Mother Jones, traveling from one union local to the next to maintain support for the strike. She was in her late 70s at the time of the strike (1913/1914) but he remembers her as a lively speaker. Prior to the import of enforcers, the operators began bringing in strikebreakers, ""scabs"". At Ludlow, strikers encountered groups of mounted, armed company guards. Baldwin-Felts enforcers for the operators terrorized the colonies, firing into them with a machine gun. John Nemo (a company guard) was killed in a skirmish at Water Tank Hill; then, the National Guard entered the area. Livoda claims that many of the National Guard were actually company guards who enlisted. John Lawson was later convicted for the crime (but freed on appeal).The strikers had more trouble with the militia men under command of Linderfelt, but fewer problems with men commanded by Frank Cise. Pat Hamrock was a colonel of the National Guard and also seen by strikers as a threat. According to Livoda, the original National Guardsmen eventually were mustered out and replaced by company enforcers who enlisted at the company's behest. According to him, the militia claimed a boy was in the Ludlow camp and wanted out -- Louis Tikas went across to negotiate and was killed. On 20 April 1914, Livoda and John Lawson left Trinidad upon receiving a plea for help from Ludlow; Livoda was in Ludlow from the 20th, for the next 7 days. Mike claims that of the strikers there were 5 men, 2 women, and 13 children killed that day (including Charlie Costa, his wife and 3 kids). The strikers had armed themselves for self-defense. After the massacre, the union bought rifles for members; members later turned their weapons in to the federal troops but retrieved them as the troops left. The Attorney General for the State of Colorado (Farrar) prosecuted cases against the miners: 435 miners were indicted after the Ludlow massacre; 168 union supporters were indicted in Las Animas County, alone. Livoda and other striking miners were indicted for murder and arson, after the Ludlow massacre. In Denver, 300 women marched on the Governor's office, demanding that Pres. Wilson send in Federal troops. Mike describes the killing of Belcher (a company enforcer); the crime was blamed on Zancanelli but was probably committed by Sam Carter or A. B. McGary; Livoda helped smuggle them out of town afterwards. Mike was involved in the fight at the Forbes mine, where strikers captured 2 machine guns from company forces. Livoda was married in 1917 and elected vice-president of the district for the UMWA in 1924. In 1918/1919, he moved on to organizing steel workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio -- working for W. Z. Foster of the A. F. of L. He then went to Calgary, Canada to deter Communist influence on the miners' union there. He returned to Colo. in 1920 and took up the office of vice-president of District 15, UMWA. Mike doesn't favor divisive ethnic strife (nor does he support student unrest on college campuses). He discusses immigrants in the early 1900s: they worked hard so that their descendants might have easier lives. Livoda criticizes the regional newspapers as tools of the coal companies -- except for the Denver Express, which was a more labor-friendly paper. He credits Pres. Franklin Roosevelt with much of workers' rights in this country.

In 1903, he began work in Pennsylvania mines, but left for Alaska and ran out of money in Montana. He worked in Red Lodge coal mines, moved on to the Leyden mine near Denver and then to southern Colorado (1910). Miners weren't paid for non-production work (timbering, laying track, etc.), had to work 10 hrs. /day instead of the statutory 8, and couldn't hire an independent weigh-man to check their coal production. In 1912, John Lawson recruited him to organize for the United Mine Workers of American, UMWA. Enforcers for the company followed Livoda everywhere, and forced him to meet with Jeff Farr (sheriff of Huerfano County), who proclaimed himself ""king of this county"". In Ravenwood, he was beaten by these enforcers. He views photos of the 1913-14 strike leaders, their opponents, the ""death special"" armored car, the ""death hole"" at Ludlow (where women and children died), the tent colony, the funeral of Louis Tikas, and the armed strikers. Also viewed are photos of Frank P. Walsh (a former miner, then the Secretary of Labor under Pres. Wilson and head of an investigatory commission), and of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (who came to Colorado after the 1913/14 strike and opened up his company's mining camps). Livoda shows an original copy of the strike call, effective 23 Sept. 1913 (when it showed heavily at Ludlow, Colorado). (The current president of the union district, Bill Hortado, invites Livoda to the Ludlow memorial service each year.) About 1500 people were living in the tent colony at Ludlow; Mike fondly remembers listening to the music coming from the tents. He sings the strike song, Union Forever. On 28 Oct., 1913, there was a fight at Ludlow: railroad men informed the strikers that guards were coming in. During the Sunday morning of 20 April 2014 -- when fighting broke out at Ludlow -- Lawson and Livoda were in Trinidad; they sped toward Ludlow; Livoda got out at Aguilar, to gather men and weapons; over 400 armed men arrived from Trinidad to support the strikers. After the Ludlow massacre, about 180 armed strikers exacted revenge upon the miners at the Forbes mine. Federal troops soon arrived, to replace the state militia. Later, John L. Lewis recruited Livoda to work for the UMWA in Pennsylvania and in Youngstown, Ohio. Mike increased union recruitment by holding meetings near the miners' homes. From there, Livoda moved to western Canada to counter communist influence upon striking coal miners. The IWW (""Wobbly"") strike occurred in Colorado in 1927. Colorado rangers would arrest hundreds of strikers and throw them into the Trinidad jail; Livoda signed the strikers' bonds and got them released. Livoda praises FDR and the NLRB, for protecting workers involved in the union. ML says the IWW didn't believe in ""contacts"" [i.e., ""contracts""] and feels the workplace would've been too chaotic under the Wobblies' leadership. He describes the UMWA as non-socialist -- tho some individuals may have favored socialism. During the violence at the Columbine Mine, Livoda was far away in the southern part of the state. He recalls his friend Henry Mathias. Livoda remembers Louis Tikas, from the Ludlow strike: speaking the same language, Tikas was able to deter the other Greek miners from acting as strikebreakers, especially in Delagua and in Berwind Canyon. (Delagua was the last mine that Livoda worked.) By 1917, the Victor American Fuel Co. was low on funds and amenable to a contract (which lasted until 1922). At their Hastings mine, over 100 men were killed in a gas explosion. Accidents declined when safety regulations were more strongly enforced. After an appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court, miners eventually forced Sheriff Jeff Farr out of office. Livoda discusses Gen. Chase, (a dentist who also served as head of the state militia at Ludlow) and the Linderfelts (one of whom struck Tikas over the head with a gun and killed him). After the 1913/14 strike, Mackenzie King was brought from Canada to head the Rockefeller Foundation, and according to Livoda ""…wasn't too bad a guy."" Livoda met John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in Trinidad. Mother Jones warned Livoda to be careful in the mines. Her father had mined in Ireland, and she had gone into the mine with him. In Pennsylvania, she became active in coal miners' union but she also helped with other struggles, such as the copper-miners' strike in upper Michigan. She was on the payroll of the UMWA. He also met Emma Goldman, who was with the IWW. Livoda's specialty was union-organizing. He felt that it should be approached like doing a good job: plan and arrange organizing efforts for an 8-hour (or longer) day. Mike actually worked in the mines for 10 years. In later life, John R. Lawson worked for Josephine Roach in a management position for Rocky Mountain Fuel Co. She took on too much debt, at a time when the entire coal-mining industry was in decline. Livoda expects demand for coal to rebound, when oil and gas become scarcer. Also, he believes that coal produced domestically would be more secure than reliance upon foreign suppliers of oil and gas. Livoda feels that corporations should be preserved but should treat their workers fairly. He favors Ted Kennedy rather than Gerald Ford in upcoming Presidential elections (1976). Looking at old photos, Livoda recalls the 1913/14 strike: Pat Hamrock wouldn't let the undertaker or coroner in to retrieve a dead striker's body. Livoda usually supports Democratic candidates, but at least once campaigned for a Republican who had proven friendly to labor. In return, Mike was hired as manager of the Red Rocks Amphitheatre (""…the best paying job I ever had in my life."") Today's miners are well supplied by their employers; in his day, Mike had to provide his own tools. Livoda reads from his list of CF&I mines: Morely, Starkwood, Engleville, Cyprus, Valdez, Segundo, Primero, Tercio, Tabasco, Bourbon, Tollerberg, Ulton, Bakerik, Hastings, Delagua, Piedmont, Majestic, Forbes, Ramey, Cedar Hill, Bear Canyon, Vines, Empire, Royal; Green Canyon, Jewel, Southwestern, Rapson, Rugby, Primrose, Colorado, Diamond, Cokedale, Dick, Boncarbo, and Suffield. After 1927, coal mining began to decline in this area. Trinidad, especially, has suffered from the loss of business and income. Livoda recalls several members of the war labor board, on which he was CIO representative.",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,"Livoda, Mike",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1978-06,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda4,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda2,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/0ozkwe,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda3,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/13ae6y,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda1,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/rohcy8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Las Animas County, CO","Ludlow, CO","Aguilar, CO","Huerfano County, CO",,,"Trinidad, CO","Walsenburg, CO",,,,1903/1974,,,,,,,,JZ,,,,,

At Walsenburg and Trinidad miners were fired if their union membership was discovered. In 1913 at Trinidad, the miners' convention voted to strike. The coal companies controlled all the mining camps, including the housing. On 23 Sept. 1913 the strike began at Ludlow during a snow and sleet storm. Miners and their families were forced to move out of company housing during storm. The union initially provided 1 large tent as a temporary shelter for the entire colony. Company guards were mounted, armed, and in large groups (up to 50 men). Ludlow was where the train would stop, bringing in strikebreakers. Guards and miners would clash, especially after a few drinks. John Nemo was killed. There were about 1800 people at Ludlow and about 2000 at Aguilar. Tent colonies appeared at most of the mining camps (Forbes, Suffield, Walsenburg), except at Aguilar (which was a pre-existing, ""free town""). Sheriff Belcher wore a steel vest for protection. In Trinidad, someone in the crowd shot and killed Belcher (possibly Zancannelli). Livoda knew 2 men who were ""involved"": Sam Carter from Oklahoma, A. B. McGeary from Des Moines, Iowa.

They cut telephone poles and installed phone lines for ~36 miles from Baggs to Powderwash. Work began during the Depression, until WWII started. (The interviewers provide background and explain their process for these interviews. They want to improve their soundtrack and to settle some questions.) Livoda reads aloud the 1913 strike call with its list of demands. The operators refused to meet with miners or to reply to their demands. Mike saw the companies' attitudes as part of a larger societal attitude, that workers were like slaves. He praises FDR. Mike was not on the union's policy committee; he was vice-president of the district, elected during the strike. The union committee wrote to operators before the 1913 strike, making a last offer to keep working. [scratchy audio ] Three major companies were involved: Rocky Mountain Fuel, Victor American Fuel, and Colorado Fuel & Iron. The strike could've been prevented, but the companies refused to meet with the miners. 80-year-old Mother Jones spoke to the miners on 15 Sept. 1913 in Trinidad, urging them to support the union and strike if needed. On 23 Sept. 1913, Mike Livoda and John Lawson went to Ludlow. People were moving into the tent colony, and it was snowing ""to beat the devil"". The railroad failed to deliver tents that had been ordered, and families had no way to cover their belongings. The union eventually supplied one 40 x 70 ft. tent. 1200-1500 people came to Ludlow from company housing. There were also tent colonies at: Aguilar, Walsenburg, Sopris, Forbes, and Trinidad (after Ludlow was destroyed). Sheriff Jeff Farr swore in more deputies, including company men brought in from West Virginia. Farr claimed to be ""king of the county"". Livoda was beaten up and shot at, before the strike. The company paid for extra deputies. [scratchy audio] There wasn't a valid election for sheriff, according to evidence before Congressional investigators. Livoda claims that Republican candidates in the county were in cahoots with the coal companies. Farr died about a year after the strike, in Walsenburg. Miners and the union bought their guns. [scratchy audio] Companies wanted Colorado Gov. Ammons to send in the state militia, in order to reduce their expenses: the former company guards became militia members. Mike describes the ""death special"", an armored car used to terrorize the tent colony. A boy at Forbes was shot and killed by them. On 28 Oct. 1913, the militia were sent in by the Colorado governor. When the strike dragged on,""regular"" militia members were mustered out and replaced by former company guards. Gen. Chase was in charge of the militia. Mike declares ""Linderfeldt was the biggest murderer that ever lived!"" Linderfeldt was a former company guard; Pat Hamrock in charge of the strike. In Jan. 1914 occurred the women's march in Trinidad, with Mother Jones confined to the hospital. Livoda was on the post office steps, when he saw the mounted militia ride into the women marchers. [scratchy audio]; Reporter Don MacGregor was killed in Mexico. Mike describes their attempts to defend the tent colony at Ludlow from the militia. Don (from the Denver Express) wrote fair reports, unlike the Rocky Mountain News or the Denver Post, Chronicle News, and the Picket Wire reporters. On 20 March 1914, the Forbes colony tents were burned. Strikebreakers had come to Forbes, trying to work. After a clash with striking miners, the strikebreakers burned the tents. Survivors had to move into Trinidad. Mike Livoda describes the efforts on 20 April 1914 of Louis Tikas, a union supporter. Most miners then were foreign-born; Tikas kept the Greeks together during the strike. He was at Ludlow during destruction of the tents and tried to negotiate an end to hostilities. Tikas approached the militia line, was struck over the head with a gun, by Linderfeldt, and died. During the 20 April 1914, Livoda and Lawson were in Trinidad, when they got a phone message about the Ludlow massacre. They drove toward Suffield and got ~27 guns ready to defend the miners' colony. At that time, there were only ~4 autos in the entire county. About 400 non-miners from Trinidad arrived on a Denver & Rio Grande train going to Ludlow. They gathered around Black Hills. [They view a Forbes mine photo.] Later, on 22 April 1914 -- before federal troops arrived -- about 250 men walked from Trinidad to Forbes. A company stooge had informed the company; strikebreakers were working in the mines, and strikers destroyed some of the company houses. Strikers also went to Primero. Two women and 11 children in the ""death hole"" at Ludlow were trying to avoid the militia. Men came from Trinidad in angry response, and there was local and national outrage at the deaths of these innocents. Mike felt that workers not treated as humans, before FDR. When recruiting in mining camps, he never came out the same way as he went in. Livoda feels that union members today don't know the sacrifices made by earlier strikers. He declares, ""The coal miners' struggle was the struggle of all the working people of this country.""",summary,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,"Livoda, Mike, 1886-1984",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1978-06,sound,audio/mp3,15-95A_Livoda,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda3,derivedFrom,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/p78404,15-96_Livoda,relatedTo,???????????,15-95B_Livoda,relatedTo,???????????,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Huerfano County, CO","Las Animas County, CO",,,,,,,,1907/1978,,,,,,,,"15-95A_Livoda audio (length =00:57:38) this audio corresponds to the first part of Livoda3 (""Interview with Mike Livoda (part 3 of 4), including his wife, Kate"").

Foreigners coming to Colorado for mining were often imported by the company, to undercut wages of resident miners. Company soaped up windows of train bringing in new foreign workers. The Union Pacific brought in Oriental miners to Rock Springs. Company recruiters would meet immigrants at Ellis Island. John L.

He started work at steel mills in Steubenville, Ohio: 12 hours/day for $1.75. He left to prospect in Alaska, but only got as far as Butte, Montana. He began coal mining: liked the work and the people (many different nationalities who all got along). He moved to Colorado: despite state law limiting work day to 8 hours, coal companies demanded 10. The company wouldn't permit the miners to hire a checkweighman, to verify the weight of their coal. Also, the companies didn't pay miners for non-production work: for timbering, or ""narrow work"". In southern Colorado, Bob Ulich got Mike to work for UMWA and to organize a miners' union; by 1912, there were ~ 8,000 miners working in the canyons near Ludlow. ML was chased out of mining camp due to organizing; he had to sneak in/out of camps. He was beaten up at Ravenwood -- thugs broke his nose. Miners could only use their ""scrip"" pay at company stores and had few rights until FDR was elected. Livoda discusses the 1913/1914 strike: on 23 Sept. 1913, the company kicked striking miners out of company housing and the snow began to fall. About 1500 people were living on $3/week strike pay in the tents at Ludlow, with others at Aguilar and Walsenburg. Lippiatt was killed in Trinidad by Belcher, who was in turn murdered in the street despite his steel vest. ML helped 2 union activists flee town after their role in Belcher's death. Zancanelli's trial for the Belcher murder ended in a hung jury. ML recalls Mother Jones, ""a good old soul"". More discussion of the Ludlow tent colony, organized by Louis Tikas and Bill Diamond. Tikas tried to keep the peace, but was killed by a militiaman. ML declares ""Linderfelt was a son-of-a-bitch."" Jeff Farr, sheriff of Huerfano County, called himself the ""king of this county"" and threw ML out of Walsenburg. After the 1913/1914 strike, Republicans hadn't elected a candidate from Huerfano County. Recalling Mother Jones, ML describes how she was seized from the train by authorities and detained in a Trinidad hospital. Women marched thru the streets to free her, but were blocked by mounted militiamen. Photos of the ""death special"" armored car, used against the strikers -- also photos of John D.

They were preparing to storm the Ludlow colony, but needed ammunition and hot food. They couldn't light a fire and didn't know the number of fatalities for almost 2 weeks after the massacre. Funerals were held for the Ludlow victims: almost 4,000 attended Louis Tikas's funeral. After the Ludlow massacre came the ""10-day war"": at Forbes mining camp, miners burned the houses of strikebreakers who were working the mine. [background hum]Mike describes John Lawson as ""a good trade-unionist"". [interspersed with fragments of a phone call] Kate Livoda joins the conversation: she describes growing up as a miner's child near Trinidad, with lots of coal mines in the area. She worked at the phone company when the strike began and met Mike when he was trying to place a call. They wed in 1917and have been married 63 years at the time of this interview. The local authorities confined Mother Jones to a hospital in Trinidad. Women marched in town and were opposed by guards on horseback. When Mother Jones was released from hospital, she joined the marchers and confronted guards with a machine gun at the bank building: placing her hands over the barrel of the gun, she declared, ""You dirty cowards, shoot if you must, but I'm not gonna move!""[background hum] When Belcher was killed in Trinidad, the phone company employees were kept at work, overnight, as the phone company feared it was too dangerous for them to go home. As a miner, Kate's father was paid in script and could only shop at the company store. Her father quit mining and they moved into Trinidad, where he helped to maintain the school buildings. Kate was at the switchboard when Bill Lippiatt was killed. Townsfolk collected guns and ammo in support of the miners; some even fought in support of the miners. Louis Tikas was trying to make peace during the Ludlow massacre; he approached the guardsmen while waving a white flag. A young man named Titsworth helped burn the tents at Ludlow, including the one over the ""Death Hole""; Kate recalls Mother Jones as ""not a ladies' lady, she was always surrounded by men. A little woman, very small."" Mother Jones exhorted the women to stand up with their men; she had a strong voice, that could be heard over a large crowd. She was also intelligent and well-spoken, but used a lot of profanity. ""She wasn't afraid of the devil."" Kate was on the post office steps, during the women's march in Trinidad. While working at the switchboard, she could listen in on conversations relating to the strike. The miners had been the major consumers in Trinidad, supporting the local stores. Kate's family would travel between mines in the caboose of a train. Her dad worked in the Primrose, Sopris, and Tercio mines. Kids would pick up spilled coal from the railroad tracks. Her father was black-balled in the mines, because of his labor activism, and then worked as a janitor in Trinidad schools. Mike was the only one she knew with an automobile. After the strike, her parents moved to California. Mike recalls the 1913/1914 strike as like ""slavery times"": men couldn't express their opinions, and ""the local officials were tools of the coal corporations."" Several of Mike's predecessors were killed, and thugs tried to kill him. Picking up his weapon, Mike declares ""that was a union rifle."" During the strike, he declared, ""the company was so powerfully strong, with the consent and allowance of the state government to crush the miners.""

Miners had no voice in selecting the check-weighman and could shop only at the company store. (Kate Livoda joins in). The mining company kicked out striking workers from company housing. The union bought land for the tent colony and gave strikers $2/week/man and $1/wife plus 50 cents/week/child. The union also provided medical care. The mothers looked after everybody's kids and tried to stick together. There were baseball games, picnics, bocce ball and cards for entertainment during the strike. During the winter before the massacre, both Lippiatt and Sheriff Belcher were killed, and women marched in support of Mother Jones in Trinidad. Federal troops called for all weapons to be turned in, but Mike buried and kept his. The union rebuilt tents at Ludlow after the massacre. There was a large tent for an office and gathering place. Local farmers provided food, and there were lots of beans to eat. Kate was in Trinidad during '03/04 strike; she recalls Glenn Aultman, a photographer in the area. Cokedale continued to work during the strike. The Sopris mine now lies beneath the water of a man-made lake. Kate thinks coal is a dirty fuel for home use. Mines from Aguilar north produced ""domestic coal""; those from Aguilar south had coking coal. There are still lots of empty buildings in Trinidad. (Kate was 84, and ML was 94 at the time of this interview.) About 300 miners (mostly Hispanic) now work the Allen mine. Mike ran CCC camp near Walden and Craig during the Depression. Mike was beaten up in Ravenwood (a Victor American Fuel Co. camp) by a company stooge while company guards watched. He stayed in a shack outside the Polish Hall 4 days to recover. Sheriff Jeff Farr ordered him to get out and stay out, claiming ""I'm the king of this county!"" After the Ludlow massacre, there were 10 days of war before Federal troops arrived. Mike organized the men to fight: in Aguilar, they attacked the Southwestern mine. There were also confrontations at the Rugby, Jewel, Rouse, and Primrose mines. Mike sings ""Union, forever"" [~00:38:00] An unidentified speaker describes olden days, as a child in the Trinidad area. Mike and his CCC crew worked on the Monument Lake dam. He sums up his 94 years: despite limited schooling, he ""… gained an education by associating with the type of people who were educated … struggling to win all the time; and the biggest percentage of the time, we did win."" Kate explains that ""he always has a goal."" She reports that Mike has very regular habits, and feels that ""I got a bargain."" Mike was never nervous about the future, always had faith in the future. Recalls Joe Zanatele and his wife, Emma (she was in Forbes at the tent colony; her twin infants died; the colony was attacked while everyone else was gone for their funeral). When ML started to organize for UMWA, Aguilar was the only safe place for him to live. END of interviews with ML, Kate.

He started mining in 1903 (Midland, Pennsylvania). All of his coworkers spoke Serbo-Croat, but he wanted to learn English. He left for Alaska, but got only as far as Montana. Mike mined coal in Red Lodge for 2 1/2 years. He wanted to see Denver and went to work at the Leyden mine -- but found it too close to the city. In 1910, when he moved to the southern part of state, there were 10,000 miners in two counties (Huerfano and Las Animas). Coal miners were paid only for production tonnage. Though the state law was 8 hours/day, the coal company required 10 hours and wouldn't allow any miner-hired checkweighmen. Mike felt the miners needed organization and were ""exploited like a slave"". John Lawson recruited him to organize for the UMWA on 1 Jan. 1912. Company thugs began to follow his every move. Any miner talking to Mike would be fired, immediately: one was even fired for talking to ML on a Sunday. Mike was summoned to meet Sheriff Jeff Farr in a Walsenburg saloon. The sheriff told Mike, ""I'm the king of this county. If you want to do any of your dirty work, you gonna have to do it someplace else, not in this county."" Mike examines photos of union officials and local authorities, the armored car or ""Death Special"", and the four Linderfeldt brothers. President Wilson favored labor, but there was no Labor Dept. until 1913. Wilson appointed Frank P. Walsh, to represent public's interest and to chair a commission. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. came to Colorado to investigate; he eliminated company guards. Mike organized 9 local unions after the end of the strike through 1915. He resumes his story about the confrontation in Walsenburg with Sheriff Jeff Farr. Mike was forced to leave town and hide out in Ravenwood. He returned to Trinidad, but in June went to Ravenwood (where he was beaten and kicked by five men). He hid in a coal shed in Walsenburg for 2 days, until a doctor arrived. The attack made him more vigorous as an organizer; ""I was protected by God, because I was doing something that the other people couldn't do themselves. I believe in that."" When the 1913/14 coal strike began, Mike Livoda was needed more than ever. He shows an original strike call brochure; on 23 Sept. 1913, the strike began. It began to snow heavily on the first day of the strike at Ludlow. Mike traveled around to keep the striking miners together. He sings the union song, which opened every union meeting. On 28 Oct. 1913, there was a fight outside Ludlow. On the day of the Ludlow Massacre, he and Mike Lawson were in Trinidad. Mike rounded up 27 guns to protect the tent colony, and 400-500 men from Trinidad went to help the strikers. Livoda positioned the armed men in the ""Black Hills"" near Ludlow. They couldn't have a fire, for fear of betraying their positions. Supporters came from throughout the Trinidad community and all walks of life. They also organized to protect the other camps: Aguilar, Trinidad, Walsenburg, Forbes (Supt. Nicholson at Forbes was especially mean). Federal troops were expected Sat. afternoon, and Mike didn't sleep in a bed for a week. After the strike, he worked for the UMWA. In 1918, he was sent to Pittsburgh to organize steel workers, with W. Z. Foster (later, Secretary of the American Communist Party). Livoda was also trying to support Phil Murray, candidate for CIO office in Pennsylvania. He sent Mike to Youngstown to help organize the Sheet and Tube Company. By moving union meetings nearer the workers, in 6 months they had organized 24,000 steelworkers. In 1919, Mike went to Calgary, Alberta to organize coal miners; they were being attracted to Communist Party. During the IWW (""Wobblies"") strike in 1927, Mike Livoda was in Trinidad. Strikers were opposed by the Colorado Rangers. The sheriff asked Mike to vouch for the arrested miners, so they could be released. Miners were striking to improve conditions, such as pay for non-production work and the right to hire an impartial checkweighman. After formation of the NLRB (1935), miners couldn't be fired for union membership. Livoda compares the two unions: the IWW didn't really believe in contracts and allowed wildcat strikes; the UMWA didn't promote socialism. During the 1927 Columbine mine massacre, Mike was in the southern part of state. He knew Henry Matthias. ""Tikas was a fine, fine fella"" Greeks had been brought in as strikebreakers, but Louis Tikas could speak to them and organize for the union. By March 1917, the Victor American Fuel Co. was near bankruptcy. The company faced pressure from financiers to get a union contract, to assure labor peace with their new funding. Mike tried to organize their workers in Hastings and Delagua, but couldn't get into the camps. In 1917, a gas explosion in the Hastings mine killed everyone below ground. Mine operators had to be forced to abide by safety regulations. Mike recalls Sheriff Jeff Farr (""that son of a bitch, I saw in hell""), who was kicked out of office due to election fraud. Chase was an officer in the Colorado national guard, whom Livoda called ""Chase … a corporation man"". Pat Hamrock (a saloon keeper from Denver) was in charge of company forces at Ludlow. Kate Livoda claims that one of the Linderfeldt boys killed Tikas. Mike considered Colorado Gov. Ammons a very weak person. MacKenzie King was brought from Canada and paid $25,000/year to run the ""Rockefeller union"" and the company plan. King and Rockefeller came to Ludlow for the dedication of the memorial, but were dissuaded from attending the ceremony. Mike met Rockefeller at the Harvey House in Trinidad. Mike shares his recollections of Mother Jones, who was on UMWA payroll. Mike met Emma Goldman, who was with IWW. He also recalls the Western Federation of Miners (metal-miners) and the copper strike in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. ends ~ 01:22:50.",summary,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,"Livoda, Mike, 1886-1984",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1978-06,sound,audio/mp3,15-99A_Livoda,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,15-99B_Livoda,relatedTo,???????????????????????,narv_coloradoCoal_transLivoda4,derivedFrom,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/9c4u7l,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Trinidad, CO","Ludlow, CO","Las Animas County, CO","Huerfano County, CO",,,"Walsenburg, CO",,,,,1907/1978,,,,,,,,"15-99A_Livoda audio (length =01:22:50) represents the first part of the 4th Livoda transcript ""Interview with Mike Livoda (part 4 of 4)"".

Colorado Coal Project,Interview with Bill Lloyd (introduction),,,"Margolis, Eric, 1947-",,,"McMahan, Ronald L.",,,,,,,,Coal miners -- Personal narratives,Coal mining -- Colorado -- Management,Coal mines and mining,,Colorado Fuel and Iron Corporation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"William Henry Lloyd, born 1893 in Wales, was then 84. His dad was a coal miner in Wales and in Penn., returned to Britain and then to Lafayette, Colo. Lloyd worked in an uncle's mines (Blue Ribbon and Patfield) and then in southern Colo.: Raus, Rugby, Lester, Trinidad. Bill started work in 1903, trapping in the coal mine called Frisco: 9 cents/hour, 10 hours/day. He learned mining from his dad at Cokedale. By the time he was 16, he ran a motor and drew a ""man's pay"" of $3.25/day. Before the strike, he didn't like working for CF&I: they required him to shop in the company store, paid him in script, and didn't care whether miners made money. He claims that miners paid the boss for good places to work. He worked at Suffield, driving a mule for Ef Wagstaff, until the big 1913 strike. He moved to Denver and learned automotive skills; later he and his mother moved to Walsenburg during the strike, where she ran a hotel and cooked meals for Mother Jones in jail. He recalls her as a tiny-but-feisty fighter for labor; he followed in her march on the Colorado capitol. Lloyd witnessed the shooting death of striker Lepia in Trinidad, killed by Belcher (who was later shot dead). He knew well both Sheriff Jeff Farr, in Walsenburg, and Shorty Martinez, the cop. At Ludlow, shooting broke out between the militia and the miners on a hogback ridge; Major Lester was killed in town the same day. Lloyd remembers the militia as untrained men. After the strike ended, wages increased from $3.25 to $5.25/day, so Lloyd returned to mining. Lloyd ran the car that took John D. Rockefeller, Jr. thru the Starkville mine, in 1916 or 1917. He recalls happy times in the early coal towns, under ""the Rockefeller plan"": lots of baseball games and modern houses for the miners. He joined the union in 1909 and left in 1923 -- he was in management positions until his retirement in 1961. He relates details about the Wobbly strike and the death of 6 men at the Columbine. Sheriff Lou Binan warned strikers to stay away from the mine; a couple tried to scale the fence and shooting began. Lloyd's company preferred the UMWA to the Wobblies. Sympathizers to the Wobblies had been placing IWW posters throughout the mines. In 1918 he qualified as fire boss, then as mine foreman; later he became a mine superintendent at Boulder Valley Mine. He continued to socialize with his friends, the miners. Under his leadership, the Puritan mine produced 64,000 tons of coal in month of February, 1928, producing coal for the Denver Post. At one time, he hired 500 men in an afternoon for the Puritan mine. Over time, the mine shifted from 7 days/week, year-round, to 3-4 days/week in winter and only a skeletal crew in summer. In 1932, he moved on to the JackoLantern, Monarch, Ball, Tiger, Pine Gulch and Majestic mines (in his ""spare time"", while still super at the Monarch mine). He details the design of steel-reinforced concrete dams in the mines to control water. Eventually, oil and gas development led to the decline of the Colorado coal industry (in part because coal couldn't be safely stored). He recounts details of several deaths in the mines. At those times, there were no survivor's benefits, so the miners would take up a collection for the family. In addition to single deaths, Lloyd reports there were 126 killed in Hastings, 13 in Bowen, 56 in Starkville, 13 in Cokedale, and 78 in Delawa. Lloyd discusses miners he knew from Cokedale and Boncarbo. He recalls racial and ethnic groups getting along well and living in mixed communities.

Colorado Coal Project,"Interview with Earle Stucker and Joe ""Moose"" Martinez, March 8, 1978, Delta, Colorado",,,"Margolis, Eric, 1947-",,,"McMahan, Ronald L.",,,,,,,,"Coal Strike, Colo., 1913-1914",Strikes and lockouts -- Coal mining -- Colorado,Labor disputes -- Colorado,Coal mines and mining,Coal miners -- Personal narratives,Coal mining -- New Mexico,Coal mining -- Colorado,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stucker first mined coal in the non-union Somerset mine, 1927, owned by the Utah Fuel Company. He describes it as a self-contained ""company owned camp"". Workers were paid in script and shopped at the company store. He describes 16-hour work-days, black lung (which was then known as ""miner's asthma""), and no compensation for injuries. Still, he felt his employer was better than most coal mines in the state. The workforce (which included many ethnic groups) had no machines, only picks. They had no check weighman, to validate their coal output. During the Depression (1933), they were finally able to unionize with little trouble and could finally raise safety concerns with impunity. He is upset with recent efforts at a right-to-work law. He recalls organizing Hispanic miners in New Mexico, just before they were called to active duty in the National Guard. Early mining was more physically demanding, and there were few options to a company town and store. Underground mining has become more technical, specialized, and pay is based on hourly rates (not the tonnage produced). He describes John R. Lawson, a UMW district president in 1913/14, who was shot during a strike, but later became president of Rocky Mountain Fuel Company -- Josephine Roach had controlling interest; the union lent the company money, to keep miners working. The company then signed UMW contracts. John L. Lewis sent Stucker to organize the union (UMWA). The Ludlow strike (which eventually required intervention by the regular army) broke the union in that area. By contrast, in western Colorado Stucker never saw a gun ""in the hands of the company or the men"". From about 1936-1946, Stucker worked in New Mexico, where mines were mostly non-union. John L. Lewis sent him after the failure of the 1933 strike by the National Miners' Union -- which failed to get a contract and (Stucker claims) was dominated by communists. Despite initial resistance, he eventually organized all the miners in the area. Stucker now sees an effort to destroy the UMWA. [Moose] had some organizer's training back east; he comes from a mining family on both sides. His disability is due to back injury from Thomson Creek and from black lung. The company would lay off and avoid hiring ""undesirable"" union activists; similarly, the company would alter work assignments to favor employees they liked. Moose started mining in 1947, at the age of 18, after 3 years in the navy. Stucker describes the Taft-Hartley injunction being used against the UMWA in the mid-1940s. Soon, the railroads switched from coal to oil, further threatening the coal industry. Miners instituted a 3-day workweek in July 1949, which helped deplete coal stockpiles; in March 1950, miners went on strike. The govt. invoked the Taft-Hartley law (which the union ignored), levied fines upon the union and its president, and nationalized the mine. Eventually, all parties signed a good contract. Both Moose and Stucker agree that current wages are good but that recent contracts have reduced benefits. They discuss the 1917 strike at Kebler Mine, Colorado, between UMWA and Rocky Mountain Fuel. The UMWA formed a corporation (Lou Merkin Company) to operate union mines. After the 1950 contract, the union worked toward a nation-wide agreement. Stucker organized in New Mexico among Hispanic and Navajo miners, who were often treated even worse than their Anglo counterparts. By the mid-1930s, he succeeded in signing contracts for these miners but was later attacked by company goons at a Labor Day party. Similarly, in 1973 Moose was arrested while picketing in Wyoming, handcuffed and jailed. Stucker organized in Madrid, New Mexico, where Appalachian subcontractors opposed unionization. The union struck for 16 weeks, beginning 1 April 1941; the picket line became a violent confrontation. Silver Lorenzo assisted in the organizing effort. They discuss the compensation for black lung disease, which took so long to pass that many benefits went to widows: the miners themselves had died. Stucker recalls John L. Lewis, his skill as a union organizer, even his work as a coal miner. Stucker speaks of the current strike and feels it could have a positive outcome, unifying the union. The organizers now encounter larger corporations that hope to standardize contracts by driving them down in cost, not up.

Early mining was more physically demanding, and there were few options to a company town and store. Underground mining has become more technical, specialized, and pay is based on hourly rates (not the tonnage produced). He describes John R. Lawson, a UMW district president in 1913/14, who was shot during a strike, but later became president of Rocky Mountain Fuel Company -- Josephine Roach had controlling interest; the union lent the company money, to keep miners working. The company then signed UMW contracts. John L. Lewis sent Stucker to organize the union (UMWA). The Ludlow strike (which eventually required intervention by the regular army) broke the union in that area. By contrast, in western Colorado Stucker never saw a gun ""in the hands of the company or the men"". From about 1936-1946, Stucker worked in New Mexico, where mines were mostly non-union. John L. Lewis sent him after the failure of the 1933 strike by the National Miners' Union -- which failed to get a contract and (Stucker claims) was dominated by communists. Despite initial resistance, he eventually organized all the miners in the area. Stucker now sees an effort to destroy the UMWA. [Moose] had some organizer's training back east; he comes from a mining family on both sides. His disability is due to back injury from Thomson Creek and from black lung. The company would lay off and avoid hiring ""undesirable"" union activists; similarly, the company would alter work assignments to favor employees they liked. Moose started mining in 1947, at the age of 18, after 3 years in the navy. Stucker describes the Taft-Hartley injunction being used against the UMWA in the mid-1940s. Soon, the railroads switched from coal to oil, further threatening the coal industry. Miners instituted a 3-day workweek in July 1949, which helped deplete coal stockpiles; in March 1950, miners went on strike. The govt. invoked the Taft-Hartley law (which the union ignored), levied fines upon the union and its president, and nationalized the mine. Eventually, all parties signed a good contract. Both Moose and Stucker agree that current wages are good but that recent contracts have reduced benefits. They discuss the 1917 strike at Kebler Mine, Colorado, between UMWA and Rocky Mountain Fuel. The UMWA formed a corporation (Lou Merkin Company) to operate union mines. After the 1950 contract, the union worked toward a nation-wide agreement. Stucker organized in New Mexico among Hispanic and Navajo miners, who were often treated even worse than their Anglo counterparts. By the mid-1930s, he succeeded in signing contracts for these miners but was later attacked by company goons at a Labor Day party. Similarly, in 1973 Moose was arrested while picketing in Wyoming, handcuffed and jailed. Stucker organized in Madrid, New Mexico, where Appalachian subcontractors opposed unionization. The union struck for 16 weeks, beginning 1 April 1941; the picket line became a violent confrontation. Silver Lorenzo assisted in the organizing effort. They discuss the compensation for black lung disease, which took so long to pass that many benefits went to widows: the miners themselves had died. Stucker recalls John L.

He was first a union member from 1911, part of the Western Federation. In 1914, he was in Grand Junction during the massacre at Ludlow; the call went out for armed volunteers to help the strikers. He served in the army in WWI, on the Belgian front. He started coal mining in 1924 in Berwind Canyon and soon became a timberman. He also married that year, in Berwind Canyon. During the 1927 IWW strike, he moved his family to Trinidad and lived off money his wife had gradually saved from his earnings. He thought the IWW was ""just a bunch of bull"". He had returned to work, when a Ku Klux Klan member falsely accused him of IWW membership. Massarotti describes his job as timberman: he was paid as company work, not by tonnage; his last pay was $7.75/day (at a time when loaders were earning 50-cents/ton). His mine unionized in 1933, under FDR. The company cooperated with the union, but also recruited ""spies"" within the union, to inform on union activities. He describes Cokedale as ""the best camp in southern Colorado"", with a school house, hotel, club house, baseball team and saloon. Each house had a lawn and (during WWII especially) a garden. People hunted and fished, but game was eventually depleted. Massarotti describes in detail the Boncarbo mine, which at one time employed 500 men.",,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,"Massarotti, Bill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5/23/1978,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transMassarotti,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Las Animas County, CO","Cokedale, CO","Boncarbo Mine, CO","Berwind Mines, CO",,,,,,,,1907/1933,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Mathias, mining companies managed to profit from the laborers first in the mines, and later in the mining camp stores which provided the food and supplies that were necessities for workers and their families.

They were ""hand loading coal"" in the early 1920s: doing their own drilling, timbering, track laying and shooting with black powder -- for 76¢ per ton. Expenses like the wash-house, blacksmith fees, shooting supplies were deducted from their pay; their pay was docked for rock found among the coal. Any training was informal, from older to newer miners. Mines were not yet unionized: mine bosses could give preference to certain miners. They unionized about 1932. Before the union, they often did un-paid, non-production work (such as retrieving rails after a cave-in). One brother (Jack) is now a mine boss, but abides strictly by the union contract; Shine was president of a union local in Erie, Colorado. In 1927, the Wobblies tried unsuccessfully to organize. During strike violence at the Columbine Mine, their friend Adam Bell was beaten; Jack was on the sidelines and witnessed the confrontation, and another brother was shot at. While they strongly favor the union, they admit that some union officials are overpaid and corrupt. They complain about use of the Taft-Hartley Act. About 1938, hand loading ended with the Shaker conveyor. Machine operators got $6.30/day; the rest of crew earned $5.75/day. After about 5 years, that was replaced with the joy loader. They encountered ""nigger heads"": large lumps of hard coal that had to be cut down. Coal markets have changed: more people heat now with gas, and industrial users (such as Public Service) want fine coal. Coal mines often closed in the summertime. They tried hard rock mining during slack seasons. They also worked for the National Park Service, building trails in Rocky Mountain Nat'l. Park, where they cut and peeled beetle-killed trees. They discuss the finer points of mule-driving and mice in the mines, as well as close calls and fatalities due to cave-ins. Coal towns like Erie and Lafayette, Colorado were an easy place to pick a fight and tough places to be a scab. Jack became a foreman and had to give up union membership. His work was steadier and less seasonal. He tried to volunteer for the Merchant Marine in WW II, but was ""frozen"" in his mining job. They describe safety lamp operation and hand mining in the Morley mine, because there was too much gas for machine operations. The interview concludes with a visit to an old mine site, where they explain using spragues to stop the wheels of coal cars. They review old mine signs and the names of former miners.",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,"Miller, Jack","Miller, Shine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6/16/1978,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transMiller1,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,narv_coloradoCoal_transMiller2,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/nf6x9g,187-Miller,sourceFor,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/h7wstw,189-Miller,sourceFor,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/87gi9m,188-Miller,sourceFor,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/4x403e,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Erie, CO",Colorado,,,,,,,,1919/1978,,,,,,,,"JZ: this transcript covered in 3 videos (#187, 188, 189).

They display examples of their mining certificates. Early mines had little air circulation. Miners had no wash-house and had to clean up at home. They saw mice in the mines, especially when mules and their feed were present. Coal mining was seasonal, with layoffs each spring. With the continuous mining machines came the shaker conveyors, or pan lines. Earlier mines had a more diverse coal market, with use in homes and businesses, as well as utilities. Prior to unionization, the miners lost pay on every car of coal because of inaccurate weights. They were using mules and ""hand loading"", doing all of the work except for cutting the coal. In the Clayton mine, there was too little oxygen to keep their carbide lamps burning atop their heads. The brothers and a partner owned the Mar Mine, in 1924, near Walden, Colorado. They were mining tungsten and silver. They ate in the mines, hunted jack rabbits, and ate beans for a year. A mine foreman talked Jack into applying for ""papers"" to get a better job as fire boss: he would examine the mine for safety, before miners entered. He earned $6/30/shift, 6 days/week. During the 1927 IWW ""Wobblies"" strike, they were working the Clayton mine. At the Columbine, 7 miners were killed and 10 wounded. Most mines shut down, tho the Columbine continued operating with strikebreakers. Strike leaders included Embry and Adam Bell (an Englishman, from British Columbia). The IWW gave each member a red book, for dues. No one from the IWW could negotiate with the operators. The militia arrested striking miners and held them in a barracks, guarded by machine guns. They relate the story of a deputy sheriff, trying to head off miners heading toward a violent picket line. The lawman threw a few silver dollars into the air to distract the crowd. Unarmed strikers behind the American flag marched toward what they thought was a public road (as there was a post office there). Adam Bell tried to lead strikers thru but was badly beaten; machine guns started firing on the striking marchers. The company had hired detective agencies and other strikebreakers. The militia enforced martial law, even against 2 or more gathering in the street. The brothers recall Wobbly songs, such as ""All stand together"". Embry of the IWW would disguise himself as a woman, to avoid arrest by the militia. The brothers were black-listed in the mines, after the 1927 Wobblies strike. They finally got work by threatening the foreman. Both saw plenty of fights, in and out of the mine. Later, in 1932, the UMWA organized the mines owned by Josephine Roach, such as the Columbine. One of them has applied -- unsuccessfully -- for black lung benefits since 1969. They list the complications of applying for black-lung benefits: short deadlines, lost paperwork, rulings by doctors never seen. They complain about the testing procedures for black lung disease. One has hired a lawyer to assist in his application. They discuss safety lamps and testing for methane, and they offer complaints about ignorant mine inspectors and the addition of rock dust (to control coal dust) -- which actually made the air even harder to breathe. Both have hearing loss from noise and explosions in the mines. They provide examples of favoritism by mine superintendents and bosses, especially before unionization. They preferred to work for a large operation, with first-class materials. One retired at age 65 with a $150/month pension. The still hold hard feelings against the Rockefellers for their role in the Ludlow massacre. The brothers see strip mining in northwestern Colorado as a major factor in future energy production.",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,"Miller, Jack","Miller, Shine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6/16/1978,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transMiller2,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,187-Miller,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/h7wstw,188-Miller,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/4x403e,narv_coloradoCoal_transMiller1,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/185q98,189-Miller,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/87gi9m,,,,,,,Colorado,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1919/1978,,,,,,,,JZ: no video yet found for this transcript; 13 Feb. 2014,,,,,

Any training was informal, from older to newer miners. Mines were not yet unionized: mine bosses could give preference to certain miners. They unionized about 1932. Before the union, they often did un-paid, non-production work (such as retrieving rails after a cave-in).

Colorado Coal Project,"Interview with Donald Mitchell, Walsenburg, Colorado.",,,"Margolis, Eric, 1947-",,,"McMahan, Ronald L.",,,,,,,,"Coal Strike, Colo., 1913-1914",Strikes and lockouts -- Coal mining -- Colorado,Coal mining -- New Mexico -- Colfax County,Coal miners -- Personal narratives,Coal mine accidents -- New Mexico -- Colfax County,Coal mining -- Colorado,Coal mines and mining,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He was born in the mining camp of Rouse, Colo., the child of a Scottish miner and an English mother. He describes growing up in coal camps, inventing his own toys and games. Discipline was strict, both at home and at school. He recalls homesteaders growing various crops during his childhood and believes the area was moister then, with higher stream-flows everywhere. Neighbors could rely upon each other for help during hard times. Different ethnic groups got along well. He recalls Walsenburg as a busy place, even late on a Saturday night. He started mining at the age of 18, in Taos, New Mexico, doing ""company work"" @ $7.75/day. This was after the 1913 strike, when the company was paying $1.85/day. The state brought in ""Baldwin thugs"" from West Virginia, to oppose the strikers. The militia asked strikers to surrender their weapons, and strikers saw the state militia as little more than company guards. He recalls Sheriff ""Jess Farr"" (i.e., Jeff Farr) and his deputy, Shorty Martinez, as company supporters. He feels that many immigrants were brought in specifically to ""take jobs"" that might have gone to union members. News of the Ludlow massacre spread by word-of-mouth; the press initially avoided the story. Mitchell was in Rock Springs, Wyoming at the time, but heard warnings about possible violence the night before the massacre. In 1914, violence at Ludlow subsided after the arrival of Federal troops. Working conditions improved somewhat after the strike and even more so with widespread unionization during the 1930s. After 1914, Rockefeller's businesses started a company union. In 1915, Mitchell witnessed vigilantes shooting unarmed miners and then fleeing to the courthouse for refuge. He describes the aftermath of the Ludlow strike as a ""real war"". He narrowly missed a 1915 explosion that killed 365 miners in 2 connected coalmines (the Dawson, NM coke mine owned by Phelps Dodge). He was among the unmarried volunteers who re-entered the mine to recover bodies after an explosion. Mitchell worked as a fire boss, thoroughly inspecting the mine for gas before miners were allowed to start work. He recalls plunging in a car thru the mine, in the dark, and being trapped in a cave-in. Two of his brothers also mined; 1 died in the mine. He relates union organizing efforts throughout Colorado: the northern part was organized, but southern Colorado was not until the Roosevelt administration in the 1930s. Mrs. Josephine Roach ran a model mine, with good wages and union representation. In parts of Colorado, Mitchell was fired when his union membership was discovered; he was black-listed from coal mining for a while and shifted to oilfield work. Mitchell encountered Wobblies during their strike, but was not sympathetic to their cause. Unions demanded check-weighmen, to determine the tonnage produced by each miner (for those paid by production). During slack periods in the mine, he'd do ranch work. He also worked at the Monarch mine, in Boulder County, Colorado. His best earnings were in the 1920s, when he would earn a full-shift's wages each time he entered the mine -- regardless of the length of task. After asking for the right to elect officers, he was called a communist by some local union officials. Both he and his brother have black lung disease (Pneumoconiosis, earlier known as ""miner's consumption""). He eventually won compensation, but the process took 5 years with many examinations and delays. Mitchell believes that new coal mines will be more difficult, as the accessible coal has already been mined. He thinks that mine explosions in the area -- especially for coking coal -- were due more to dust than to gas. He fears corruption in unions and the growth of government programs.

He started mining at the age of 18, in Taos, New Mexico, doing ""company work"" @ $7.75/day. This was after the 1913 strike, when the company was paying $1.85/day. The state brought in ""Baldwin thugs"" from West Virginia, to oppose the strikers. The militia asked strikers to surrender their weapons, and strikers saw the state militia as little more than company guards.

Mitchell was in Rock Springs, Wyoming at the time, but heard warnings about possible violence the night before the massacre. In 1914, violence at Ludlow subsided after the arrival of Federal troops. Working conditions improved somewhat after the strike and even more so with widespread unionization during the 1930s. After 1914, Rockefeller's businesses started a company union.

He was among the unmarried volunteers who re-entered the mine to recover bodies after an explosion. Mitchell worked as a fire boss, thoroughly inspecting the mine for gas before miners were allowed to start work. He recalls plunging in a car thru the mine, in the dark, and being trapped in a cave-in. Two of his brothers also mined; 1 died in the mine. He relates union organizing efforts throughout Colorado: the northern part was organized, but southern Colorado was not until the Roosevelt administration in the 1930s. Mrs. Josephine Roach ran a model mine, with good wages and union representation. In parts of Colorado, Mitchell was fired when his union membership was discovered; he was black-listed from coal mining for a while and shifted to oilfield work. Mitchell encountered Wobblies during their strike, but was not sympathetic to their cause. Unions demanded check-weighmen, to determine the tonnage produced by each miner (for those paid by production). During slack periods in the mine, he'd do ranch work. He also worked at the Monarch mine, in Boulder County, Colorado. His best earnings were in the 1920s, when he would earn a full-shift's wages each time he entered the mine -- regardless of the length of task.

Both he and his brother have black lung disease (Pneumoconiosis, earlier known as ""miner's consumption""). He eventually won compensation, but the process took 5 years with many examinations and delays. Mitchell believes that new coal mines will be more difficult, as the accessible coal has already been mined.

First footage shows a reporter interviewing a coal miner about his feelings about the strike which was taking place when the filming took place. Footage moves to a group of men standing in the parking lot and bantering back and forth about the history of mining. An unidentified older mine worker tells about what it was like to buy supplies at the Company Store in town, then called the ""Wash-ette"", and how they had used scrip at one time. The miner discusses the mines which were all active at different periods in time throughout the history of the area, mentioning Clear Creek and Delcarbon and others. He describes where, on a nearby hill, there were once tents where people used to live, a shower building, a water tower, a company store-and his wife was born in one of the tents that once sat on the hill. The man also says that his father lost his arm in a mining accident in the mine where they stood. He states that before the 1940s, they used mules to carry the coal out of the mines. The scene changes to inside the bar, where a news program is discussing the coal mining strike and it's national effects on the automobile industry and american households. A spokesperson for the United Mine Workers, Douglas Fraser, appears on the screen and comments on the strike and the mine working conditions. Men in the bar shout insults at the comments made by the reporters on the television and other government representatives who think the strike is unreasonable.",summary,,SegmentSequence,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,"Morgan, Bill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3/7/1978,MovingImage,video/mp4,136-Portal,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Somerset, CO","Paonia, CO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He worked with a pick and shovel 10 hours per day, for $1.10/day, 6 days/week in a non-union mine. He worked for 40 years and was not injured until 1958. At the time of the Ludlow massacre, he was on a site in Rugby, Colorado. He speaks highly of Mother Jones, who began union organizing in this area. After the massacre, he didn't feel there was anything he could do -- the militia was in place, followed by the U.S. Army -- but he feels they won that strike, gaining higher wages and shorter work-days. His last work was in the Morning Glory mine, 1958, and he's on a pension now. He'd prefer that his son and grandsons not work in the mine. He started work ~1907, in Hedron, working under Mr. Mitchell; many of the bosses were Scottish or Welsh. Owens has heard that some Italian or Slavic immigrants ""bought"" their jobs, by paying the pit bosses for choice jobs in the mines -- he doesn't know this to be true. Owens's father was also a miner, tho he never took his son into the mines. As needed, the mines would move miners around, at no cost to the workmen: Owens's family moved from Rock Springs, Wyoming to Rugby, Colorado, to New Mexico and back to Colo. His father and the children played in a band. When the mines were active, the coal towns were lively with sports and other entertainment. Growth of oil and gas industry led to a rapid decline in the demand for coal, as did the reduced demand by railroads. The area around Walsenburg produced ""domestic coal"", while the mines near and south of Trinidad produced ""coking coal"". Owens was in the area in 1927 for the ""Wobbly"" strike , but he did not go out on strike (which was over quickly where he was working (Ravenwood)). During the 1913 strike, he didn't work. He recalls talking to John L. Lewis, whom he respected. He was temporarily blinded due to a welding accident in the mines. During his mining career, lighting switched from oil to carbide lamps to electric lights. After WWI, he switched briefly to railroad work, but returned to mining and drove a 5-mule team. As an African-American, he didn't see much prejudicial behavior in the coal mines, nor in the coal towns -- after a day's work, everyone was black. In the coal towns, all the ethnic groups lived together. He talks about Sheriff Jeff Farr (""Fatty Farr"") -- while they got along OK, the Sheriff did run the dept. on his personal whims and is alleged to have stolen land from Hispanics. Owens feels many miners bring accidents upon themselves thru carelessness. He reports lots of coal dust in the mines, especially from the cutting machines. Owens is on a black lung pension, himself. In Kennilworth, Utah, he ran a cutting machine that used water to reduce coal dust. Government inspectors visited the mine yearly for safety testing, but too often knew little about mining. By the 1940s, he averaged $25/day; he quit after his 2nd injury, in his 60's. He did contract work: pay was determined by quantity of coal he cut. He also shot the coal he had cut: drilled holes, loaded them with powder, tamped it down and lit the shots. He usually started work in the afternoon, after previously cut coal was loaded out. He would work long shifts, sometimes until the next morning. He was a popular co-worker, as others couldn't load coal until he had cut and shot it.

He worked with a pick and shovel 10 hours per day, for $1.10/day, 6 days/week in a non-union mine. He worked for 40 years and was not injured until 1958. At the time of the Ludlow massacre, he was on a site in Rugby, Colorado. He speaks highly of Mother Jones, who began union organizing in this area. After the massacre, he didn't feel there was anything he could do -- the militia was in place, followed by the U.S. Army -- but he feels they won that strike, gaining higher wages and shorter work-days. His last work was in the Morning Glory mine, 1958, and he's on a pension now. He'd prefer that his son and grandsons not work in the mine. He started work ~1907, in Hedron, working under Mr. Mitchell; many of the bosses were Scottish or Welsh. Owens has heard that some Italian or Slavic immigrants ""bought"" their jobs, by paying the pit bosses for choice jobs in the mines -- he doesn't know this to be true. Owens's father was also a miner, tho he never took his son into the mines. As needed, the mines would move miners around, at no cost to the workmen: Owens's family moved from Rock Springs, Wyoming to Rugby, Colorado, to New Mexico and back to Colo. His father and the children played in a band. When the mines were active, the coal towns were lively with sports and other entertainment. Growth of oil and gas industry led to a rapid decline in the demand for coal, as did the reduced demand by railroads. The area around Walsenburg produced ""domestic coal"", while the mines near and south of Trinidad produced ""coking coal"". Owens was in the area in 1927 for the ""Wobbly"" strike , but he did not go out on strike (which was over quickly where he was working (Ravenwood)). During the 1913 strike, he didn't work. He recalls talking to John L. Lewis, whom he respected. He was temporarily blinded due to a welding accident in the mines. During his mining career, lighting switched from oil to carbide lamps to electric lights. After WWI, he switched briefly to railroad work, but returned to mining and drove a 5-mule team. As an African-American, he didn't see much prejudicial behavior in the coal mines, nor in the coal towns -- after a day's work, everyone was black. In the coal towns, all the ethnic groups lived together. He talks about Sheriff Jeff Farr (""Fatty Farr"") -- while they got along OK, the Sheriff did run the dept. on his personal whims and is alleged to have stolen land from Hispanics. Owens feels many miners bring accidents upon themselves thru carelessness. He reports lots of coal dust in the mines, especially from the cutting machines. Owens is on a black lung pension, himself. In Kennilworth, Utah, he ran a cutting machine that used water to reduce coal dust. Government inspectors visited the mine yearly for safety testing, but too often knew little about mining. By the 1940s, he averaged $25/day; he quit after his 2nd injury, in his 60's. He did contract work: pay was determined by quantity of coal he cut. He also shot the coal he had cut: drilled holes, loaded them with powder, tamped it down and lit the shots. He usually started work in the afternoon, after previously cut coal was loaded out. He would work long shifts, sometimes until the next morning. He was a popular co-worker, as others couldn't load coal until he had cut and shot it.

She recalls the UMWA meeting hall, with Mother Jones (who she describes as a tiny, white-haired tea-drinker) and organizer Jonah Lawson. Two of her brothers were in the Maitland mine explosion. Her parents were both English immigrants, tho there were many Welsh and Chinese miners at Maitland. Her father abandoned the family while she was quite young; her mother survived by running boarding houses for miners. In 1913 followed the Ludlow strike and massacre. With the strike, miners' families were expelled from the company houses; they moved to a tent colony. The miners took up positions on the hogback between Walsenburg and Pictou. The militia major P. P. Lester (who was also the company doctor) was wounded and brought out by a striker-volunteer. Miners fought back after the massacre, trying to keep the militia in check. Fortunately, a hailstorm interrupted what promised to be a fatal encounter between the two sides. They fled to the Seattle area, her husband worked in the ship yards during World War I, and eventually they returned to Erie, Colorado. Her brother-in-law (John Simpson) was a union organizer in Trinidad, Colorado. One of her brothers started work as a 12-14 year old in the tipple. As a child, she helped out by collecting slag coal for home use in the winter. Her family ran boarding houses at the Rocky Mtn. Camp, so she helped with chores. She recalls the hard work but was happy at the time. Gardens weren't possible, as they had to haul water for all their needs. They enjoyed dances and attending baseball games. She recalls that Sheriff Farr (of Walsenburg) was not well-liked by the miners. With only a company doctor and the nearest hospital in Pueblo, medical care was limited. At Ludlow, the company doctor (Major Lester) was also an officer in the militia, and he is alleged to have fired on the miners he used to treat as patients. In fatal mine accidents, the miner's body was cared for by the community -- there was no funeral home nearby. Her husband was black-listed at the Rocky Mountain Coal Co., probably because of his Democratic Party activities. Coal mining was seasonal, with many laid off in the summer. Pay was monthly, with deductions for the company housing and coal and with script to be used at the company store. None of her children or grandchildren is a miner.",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,"Pickett, Lottie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1976,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transPickett1,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pictou Mine, CO",,"Maitland Mine, CO","Ludlow, CO",,,,,,,,1891/1976,,,,,,,,CAH: no video for this transcript.,,,,,

He started in 1924 at Rocky Mountain Fuel (Pierredon mine, Colorado) as a contract worker: loading, shooting, and timbering. Living in Frederick, Colorado, he started mining with and learned from his dad, who worked about 1918-1932. Max enjoyed the work, though it was hard. There was no union initially; he joined the IWW, but its 1927 strike was broken by area farmers working as strikebreakers. He was fired at by the militia during the strike. Mining jobs were irregular, with little work in summer. He was injured in an electrical accident with the joy loader, and 4 years ago injured in the back and shoulder. The joy loader created a lot of coal dust, with visibility often less than 10 feet. The mining process created lots of mud and dust and included dangerous, moving machinery. Fortunately, his mines did not have much gas. His initial black lung claim was denied; the exam did not show enough damage to support his claim. He didn't drink alcohol or use tobacco. When working second shift, he'd work 3-11:30 and took his meal in the mine: ""you never come out once you go in"". He felt production could've been doubled, if supervisors had allowed time for sumps and water drainage. He suspects that oil companies will recover the unexploited coal, as they drill thru it. He fears that younger miners are too short-sighted to organize for the union: they'd rather just take high wages while they can. Most mines in his area are now closed, but 2 of his sons worked in the coal mines. At the end, Max was earning $28.05 [per shift?]. There was a lot of ""dead"" time: waiting for coal to be loaded, etc. Max preferred to help out others, rather than just stand around.

Colorado Coal Project,Interview with Lee Scamehorn,,,"Margolis, Eric, 1947-",,,"McMahan, Ronald L.",,,,,,,,CF & I Steel Corporation,Strikes and lockouts -- Coal mining -- Colorado,Labor disputes -- Colorado,Coal mines and mining,"Coal Strike, Colo., 1913-1914",Denver and Rio Grande Railroad Company,Coal mining -- Colorado,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Scamehorn was an archivist for the Colorado State Historical Society and a history professor at CU-Boulder. He grew up in Taylorville, Illinois (site of a struggle between progressives and the UMWA) and wrote his master's thesis on the Illinois coal industry. When he first came West in 1956, one saw numerous coal-waste piles near Boulder; the last Boulder County coal mine closed in the 1950s. CF&I wanted a company history written, which led to the development of a business history research center at CU-Boulder. Coal mining in this area began with the coal survey conducted by Hayden for the USGS in 1860s. Brief discussion of the Ludlow Massacre follows: they contend that there are contradictory stories about what really happened at Ludlow, and that the company's viewpoint has never been well expressed. Scamehorn details the development of CF&I: the mill was sited at Pueblo to be close to resources. He elaborates the close relationship between railroad development and coal mining: coal was often the first objective and constituted much of the traffic once the line was developed. Because of the isolation and lack of development, the company often ended up creating a town. He relates John Osgood's role in expanding steel production at CF&I. Osgood died in 1926, as head of Victor American. CF&I was taken over by John Rockefeller, Sr. and George Shay Gould, with John D. Rockefeller (Jr.) involved after 1905. The Panama Canal shifted some business away from CF&I. Unlike other railroads, the Denver & Rio Grande and CF&I produced their own rails. They compare eastern vs. western coal mining: western coal featured more ""company towns""; eastern coal towns were more diversified; similar ethnic groups were found in both areas (especially Italians and Slavs); eastern coal mines used machines earlier; western mines included more small mines, which eventually offered immigrants a path into managerial positions. They discuss the future of coal and industrial production in the Front Range, as well as efforts to tell business's history. Images of coal mining areas are described, which were often produced for the coal companies. The ""sociological department"" was a pet project of John Osgood, initially at CF&I and later at the Redstone mine. He favored ""welfare capitalism"" as an effort to head off unionization, and he promoted an educated, healthy workforce as a business model. In 1917, he controlled Victor American and was always a fervent temperance advocate. He sponsored club activities in coal towns, as alternatives to saloons, which leads to a broader discussion of alcohol problems in coal mining.

As a child, she witnessed bullying of strikers by the militia. In the coal camps, they enjoyed simple pleasures: going to Walsenburg for ice cream, to dance, and to visit others; in the Pryor camp, they had a movie theatre, dances, and occasional carnival. Susie quit school after the 5th grade, when her mother died of the flu in 1918 -- leaving 8 children. They baked their own bread and washed clothes by hand. Tom started mining at age 15 and worked for 54 years at the Morrison and Eagle mines. He witnessed use of canaries, to detect ""black damp"". He also noticed that mice would flee the mine just before a cave-in. He has black lung disease, which may have resulted from increased coal-dust levels after mechanization of coal mining. In 1932, he was injured in a mine explosion in Carbondale in Walsenburg and couldn't work for 8 months. After recovery, he avoided mining and instead did construction work in Longmont. They were shunned by others in Longmont, where coal miners were not appreciated. Coal mining was seasonal, with usually no work in summer and at its peak during the coldest part of winter. He saw the introduction of coal-mining machines, which eventually reduced the need for labor. He feels the union made excessive demands, which eventually led to some mine closures. However, demand for coal was high during World War II.

John started mining at age 15, after 8th grade. Ethnic groups lived in separate neighborhoods but got along in the same school. As a child, he lived in a tent (among a family of 8) in Ludlow before the massacre. After the massacre, his father was black-balled for 4 years, because of his participation in the strike. The 1913 strike eventually led to union recognition by Victor American Fuel Company in 1918. Work conditions were harsh: getting docked for small amounts of rock in the coal car -- un-paid non-production work (framing, laying track) -- all hand work with picks. During the 1922 strike (Delagua), the militia came in to harass miners, monitor visitors to town, and to break-up the union. Union bands led people to meetings outside the town; union sympathizers (""red necks"") wore red bandanas as a gesture of support. The couple moved to Utah after the 1922 strike and a pay dispute. Coal town life included dances, movies, picnics, fishing trips, visiting each other and enjoying home-made wine. During the 1933 strike in Spring Canyon, Utah, he spent about 10 days in a ""bull pen"" jail. Miners clashed with company enforcers and KKK sympathizers (Mormon youths and other farm kids). A march in Price, Utah was tear-gassed by militia. Women were fire-hosed by militia when marching to release the men from jail.

John started mining at age 15, after 8th grade. Ethnic groups lived in separate neighborhoods but got along in the same school. As a child, he lived in a tent (among a family of 8) in Ludlow before the massacre. After the massacre, his father was black-balled for 4 years, because of his participation in the strike. The 1913 strike eventually led to union recognition by Victor American Fuel Company in 1918. Work conditions were harsh: getting docked for small amounts of rock in the coal car -- un-paid non-production work (framing, laying track) -- all hand work with picks. During the 1922 strike (Delagua), the militia came in to harass miners, monitor visitors to town, and to break-up the union. Union bands led people to meetings outside the town; union sympathizers (""red necks"") wore red bandanas as a gesture of support. The couple moved to Utah after the 1922 strike and a pay dispute. Coal town life included dances, movies, picnics, fishing trips, visiting each other and enjoying home-made wine. During the 1933 strike in Spring Canyon, Utah, he spent about 10 days in a ""bull pen"" jail. Miners clashed with company enforcers and KKK sympathizers (Mormon youths and other farm kids). A march in Price, Utah was tear-gassed by militia. Women were fire-hosed by militia when marching to release the men from jail. UMWA and the National Miners Union were trying to organize in the area; the coal companies contracted with UMWA.

They moved out of their company house that night amidst 3 feet of snow. She was stranded 4 days alone at a ranch while her husband was jailed by the company in Trinidad. They eventually found refuge in a tent in the union camp in Ludlow. John D. Rockefeller's company and the state militia made camp life difficult. Single women shuttled weapons and supplies to the fighting strikers; she was shot at, leaving her hat with a bullet hole. Union railroad crews near the strikers deployed trains as blockades, gave them water from the engine supplies, and sounded the alert when strikebreakers were arriving. Ranchers and merchants provided food for the strikers and families. Supporters from Trinidad and elsewhere brought clothing and bread; they provided electricity and a street light for the union camp. Strikers depleted the area of fish and even pet cats. Women walked the picket line, before the massacre. When the militia began shooting, women and children hid in the dry creek bed. Miners were striking not just for pay, but also for benefits to those injured or killed on the job. They demanded a shorter work-day, more protection in the mine and the right to pick up spillage. They had been forced to shop at the company store and take their pay in trade. On 20 April 1914 she was asleep in a tent, next to the parents and child killed and portrayed in the monument at Ludlow. Strikers and supporters were shot by militia, angering the union camp. She reports that someone started the fire at night, splashing kerosene about to worsen the flames. People with only their nightclothes fled the union camp toward the highway. She survived with frostbitten feet. There were no caskets, so the dead were wrapped in canvas and buried in the prairie. After the massacre, she spoke before union meetings with Mother Jones. Following a march in Trinidad, Mother Jones was detained in the hospital. The strike dragged on, mines closed, and her husband found ranch work. Eventually, the strike failed. The couple settled in Crested Butte.",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,"Tonso, Angela","[Tonso, Angeline]",,"[Tonso, Mrs. Raymond]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,10/12/1983,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transTonso,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ludlow, CO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1913/1983,,,,,,,,JZ: no video yet found for this transcript. 24 Mar. 2014,,,,,

Mr. Voll names numerous people seen in the film. Also seen are: an arch and underpass leading into town, the fire engine, the ""balance rock"" formation on cliff at edge of town, the school, local newspaper, local grocer, the bank, service station, barber shop, the Castle Gate rock formation outside of town. The film shows loading of coal into trucks at the Spring Canyon Coal Co. The mines used gravity to move coal cars. Also seen are the Standardville school, bakery, 1940 footage of a new car, the furniture store, dairy, a sweet shop/theatre, and the railroad roundhouse. Railroad footage ends ~ 20:30. Voll discusses screening of the movie for longtime residents. We see a slide-show about the coal industry in Carbon County, Utah, including coal seams , Castle Gate -- where Butch Cassidy robbed the payroll at the oldest continuously-used mine office in the U.S. All the mining equipment has now been removed. The town was named Helper because it was the place where engines were added, to get the train up the hill. Also seen are views of the company town of Standardville (almost all now removed), views of Sunnyside (served by Rio Grande RR), close-ups of the ""balanced rock"" formation, a photo of the ""Big John"" mythical figure, the town hospital, steam power plant, and Scofield, Utah. Mr. Voll describes the murals seen in the Helper Coal Mining Museum: they show the settlement of Winter Quarters, early hand-mining with picks, hand-drilling, and the first railroad from Springville to Tucker. This was a ""cut-back"" track: the engine would go up to the first curve and then back up along the next leg of the slope. Murals also shoe the coke ovens at Sunnyside (""bee-hives"" which were then the largest coke ovens in the world).

As production wound down, the company was finding too much ""sulphur"" rock per load of coal. His dad died of ""miner's consumption"" (i.e. black lung). Wojtylka recalls many nationalities in Cokedale, including some Japanese miners when he was young. He also remembers an explosion in the mine. During a strike at Cokedale, scabs were beaten up by union members from out of town. (There had been less union organization at Cokedale, but more at Sopris and other nearby mines.) During the 1927 ""Wobblies"" strike (which in this area started at Valdez by the IWW), strikers scattered nails on the road. Cokedale coal mines had gotten union organization by 1943. The companies even provided bus transport to the coal mine. Wojtylka details conflicts between old-timers and newcomers to town. He served on the town council for quite a while; they organized town services after the company sold out. Cokedale is one of the few company towns that survived. Buildings sold for about $400 for a 4-room house. Over time, home heating has changed from coal to natural gas. Mining pay changed from script (when he was young) to gold to cash to checks. There were a few thefts of payroll from the company. In the coal camps, people seemed to enjoy life more than neighbors in cities or on farms. Neighbors often got together for parties and seemed able to get by, with less money. Wojtylka feels that today's workers expect more for less effort and are not willing to work. Mining camps were less isolated than ranches and farms, and also had shorter work-days. Working conditions in the mines were much better if it wasn't low coal. During Prohibition, some families made wine at home; there were a few bootleggers of whisky, also. There was even some gambling in Cokedale, many years ago. They used to enjoy streetcar service from Cokedale to Trinidad. Today, Wojtylka decries high prices and wages; he feels that people are unwilling to work for a good life. He compares life and costs today vs. during Roosevelt's presidency. Wojtylka admits that small towns such as Cokedale have governance problems because people are in conflict with each other. There's a surprising amount of conflict in such a small town: witness their difficulties finishing the local sewer service.",summary,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,"Wojtylka, Frank 1906-1983",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5/23/1978,MovingImage,video/mp4,178-Wojtylka,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Las Animas County, CO","Cokedale, CO",,,,,,,,1922/1978,,,,,,,,JZ: no transcript yet found for this video; 27 Mar. 2014,,,,,

He had moved to the U.S. and worked a few years, then went back to Germany to marry. He was a union supporter; their house was blown up as retribution for his union activities. At Sopris, the miners' wives united to stay in a boarding house, while their men were away at a march in Huerfano County. She recalls the strike in 1903, when her father was beaten. At age 12, her father fell ill and Emma began work doing laundry; he died in 2 years. Emma married in July of 1913, to a pit boss at the Forbes mine. He walked out when the company imported African-American strikebreakers. When the 1913 strike began in September, the company forced the Zanetells out of company housing. For the next 2.5 years, they lived in the tent colony at Forbes: stifling in summer heat and miserable in winter's snows. When people were gone to the funeral for her twins, the militia burned all the tents but hers. She was recovering, inside, and would've died -- but one militiaman threatened to kill the other if she were harmed. Her husband was blacklisted, but eventually worked at Ramey. She describes packing a hearty lunch in her husband's bucket for work. They view a photo of her friends and family in front of her tent. (There is a change of interviewers to Angela.) The Zanetells have been in their present home in Aguilar since 1916. Emma bore 13 children, 5 of whom died as children. During the coal strike of 1913-1914, her family lived in the tent colony near the Forbes mine in Colorado. There she lost 2 sets of twin children, who died shortly after their births in the tent. Company doctors would not come to help, because the miners had moved out of company housing. Doctors from town couldn't reach the tent colony, because of shooting along the route. Her children were delivered by other women in the tent colony. Dr. Beshoar, the UMW doctor, eventually came to her aid by crawling along the creek-bed to the Forbes colony. Company guards and militiamen burned the other tents, while the community was gone to Trinidad to bury her dead infants; Emma's was the only tent left standing -- because she was still inside, recovering. One militiaman threatened to kill the other if any harm came to her. After the strike, her family lived at Ramey and Aguilar, Colorado. For a while, she went to the cemetery daily to grieve for her dead children. Her husband worked at the Royal and Empire mines (where an explosion occurred and the mine whistle sounded the alarm to the families in town). Her 8 surviving children attended school in Aguilar and have each moved on to successful adult lives. The Great Depression was especially hard in 1939, but they always had plenty of food. The family rejoiced when her 4 sons returned home safely from World War II. She views photos and recalls the women's march in Trinidad, Mother Jones, and the family's tent at the Forbes colony.",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,"Zanetell, Emma 1893-1985","[Zanatell, Emma]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6/27/1978,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transZanetell,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,201-Zanetell,sourceFor,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/staa7h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Royal Mine (Las Animas County, CO)","Ramey Mines, CO","Las Animas County, CO","Aguilar, CO",,,"Sopris Mine, CO",,,,,1913/1978,,,,,,,,JZ: transcript's first 29 pages NOT included in video; video continues another 12 minutes after transcript ends -- 18 Mar. 2014,,,,,

Colorado Coal Project,Interview with Mr. and Mrs. Steve Zoolakis,,,"Margolis, Eric, 1947-",,,"McMahan, Ronald L.",,,,,,,,Coal miners -- Personal narratives,United Mine Workers of America,Strikes and lockouts -- Coal mining -- Utah,Coal mining -- Utah -- Carbon County,Coal mines and mining,Labor disputes -- Utah,Greek Americans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(no transcript for this interview) 10:00 -- conflicts with mine superintendents, before unionization 20:00 -- describes hand loading coal in early coal mines 28:14 -- Mrs. Zoolakis speaking 30:00 -- relations between Greeks and Mormons in this area 40:00 -- she describes touring a coal mine 42:20 -- Mr. Zoolakis re-joins conversation 50:00 -- discussing his brother's problems after mine injury and conflict with the law 60:00 -- discussing other old-timers in the area who might recall early coal mining",SegmentSequence,"This 80 year-old, Greek-American miner followed a cousin to America, after three of his brothers were killed in wars with the Turks. He describes early disputes in the coal mines, before unionization, and strike violence at the Hiawatha Mine. Despite being black-listed, Zoolakis remained in the UMWA union since 1922. Earning only $3.15 for an 8-hour day, he still managed to send money to his family in Greece. In the early days, he was hand-loading coal for only 27 cents/ton, up to 18 tons/day. He came to Utah, became a U.S. citizen, and raised 3 sons (none of whom followed into the mines). He worked 49 years and retired from US Steel. In mines, he worked as a helper (assisting with the coal mining machines). There were a couple of hundred other Greeks in the Columbia, Utah area. He suffers from some lung problems and knee pain (due to working in ""low coal""). He also worked the Castle Gate coal mines. Mrs. Zoolakis was born in Greece also, grew up in Sunnside (Utah), and met her husband in America. Years ago, there were many nationalities in the area, but few conflicts among the diversity community. She reports that people now tend to stick more with their own kind, and that Mormons are more distant with their Gentile neighbors. She proudly describes her 3 sons' careers and families. Of 75 families living in Columbia, all but 2 children got post-secondary education. She worked as a nurse's aide and LPN (in the Kaiser Permanente hospital in Dragerton, Utah), to help put their sons thru school. All 3 sons have master's degrees. Her husband worked double shifts in the mine during WWII. She recalls that during the war, there was good money for a short while; soon, the mines began to decline and there were fewer jobs. She worked as an occupational nurse, conducting pre- and post-employment checks for miners. She remembers that 375 men were laid off at one time, and many left the area. Now, she notices some new hiring, as the demand for coal returns. As preparation for her work, she toured a coal mine and found it to be cold and scary. Mr. Zoolakis re-joins the conversation, and both discuss accidents in the mines, such as huge coal chunks crushing a miner. The couple describe ""bounces"" -- unexpected movements of coal within the mines. When fatalities occurred in mining accidents, the mine foreman and a doctor would notify families at home. Zoolakis's brother was injured in the mine, leading to a succession of other problems and conflicts with the law. These extended internationally to battles during WWI in Crete against the Turks. Zoolakis relates what he knew of a fellow Greek, Louis Tikas from the Ludlow strike; Zoolakis claims than the militia offered Tikas $30,000 to leave the strike. The couple describe strikes in their area of Utah -- not in 1933, but in 1937, lasting for 9 months. They received some food commodities, which they supplemented by hunting rabbits and deer. The UMWA was finally recognized by mine operators in 1937. They mention other old-timers in the area who might recall the early coal-mining era. They recall their earlier struggles for mine safety, shorter work-days, and union representation.",summary,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,"Zoolakis, Mrs. Steve","Zoolakis, Steve",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4/25/1978,MovingImage,video/mp4,153-Zoolakis,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiawatha Mine, UT","Dragerton, UT","Columbia, UT","Carbon County, UT",,,"Sunnyside, UT","Price, UT",,,,1922/1978,,,,,,,,JZ,,,,,

Most began working at age 12 or 14 and continued for some 35 years, moving from place to place, wherever jobs were. They recall 2-mile walks to the mine, 10-hour work days in dust-filled shafts, and low wages. They believe the well-being of the mining mules was of more concern than their own. There is brief talk about the Ludlow Massacre. Later, when the ""continuous miner"" machines were brought in, miners were laid off. Much of Colorado coal is 500 ft. underground, and they discuss strip mining, which is cheaper, even with the additional land reclamation costs. They feel that nuclear power produces more pollution but burning coal could be made to burn cleaner. They speak about Black Lung compensation and look back on the history of strikes in Colorado beginning in 1893.",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1975/1978,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transErieReflex,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ludlow, CO",,"Erie, CO",Colorado,,,,,,,,1893/1978,,,,,,,,CAH: no video,,,,,

The class doubt that troops have ever been sent into a coal mine. Then follows discussion of the non-union status of a new mine (Westmoreland), where the union is picketing to seek recognition. The group doubt that the facility will unionize, as the pay and benefits are already good. There have been minor incidents of vandalism, but even the picketers have cooperated with the management to clean up afterwards. The members mention the complexity of the proposed contract, and they draw distinctions between eastern vs. western coal mines. Some youngsters complain about boredom in this small town. There are remarks about the rate of growth (22% increase in population from 1974-1978). A recent bond issue was defeated, perhaps because much of the voting population were retirees on fixed incomes and feared increased taxes. The group feel that there has been modest increase in local jobs, but not so much as in Craig or Hayden, Colorado. There has been some local resistance to growth and concern about new growth in floodplains. Conversely, some residents complain that about a lack of shops or recreation choices. The interviewer queries the audience about major mine disasters nearby: they recall that in the Somerset mine, 4 miners were killed in a cave-in in 1969. After high school most girls leave the area, while some boys stay to work in the mines. Summer work is difficult to get. They discuss the first woman miner in the area: there was initial resistance (especially from older miners who considered women in the mine as bad luck) but more acceptance now. Most of this audience wouldn't want to work that hard, under those difficult/dangerous conditions. Members discuss plans after high school graduation: most plan on college, outside the area. Many guys return to the area and work in the mines, after trying college, because of the good pay. There's mention of working as miner vs. as a ""company man"": there seems to be less strife between groups here than in more entrenched communities. There has been some migration from Crested Butte, after mines closed there. Some families were originally Yugoslav or Austrian. Residents report some resentment of the impact of large construction crews, who briefly move into an area, make a lot of demands upon it, but then leave. There are conflicts with some ""environmentalists"", but there are also legitimate, local concerns about the environmental impact of Westmoreland's mining operations. The term ""newcomers"" is used broadly here: many long-time residents are still called that. There are concerns about rapid growth in the area, demands upon a limited water supply, and the need for zoning and land regulations. Some residents voice specific concerns about ""trailer houses"".",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3/9/1978,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transMedia,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,144-Union Meeting,sourceFor,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/i887q1,143-Media-Class,sourceFor,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/w8hd1f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Paonia, CO","Delta County, CO",,,,,,,,1969/1978,,,,,,,,CAH: Pages 1-18 are 35:45 to 1:03:00(end) of Media Class video.,,,,,

The Sheriff moved here from New Jersey about 7 years ago and still feels like a ""newcomer"". Newcomers have difficulty finding a place to live, but the economy is thriving and skilled workers are in high demand. Crime has also increased, with a 3- to 4-fold increase in civil actions by the Sheriff's office. The Sheriff disputes claims of high rates of juvenile delinquency and also feels the area's drug usage is typical of the nation's. Recreational opportunities for young people are limited. The Sheriff agrees there are some problems with transient workers, but feels they are not out of proportion. Newcomers and long-term residents often conflict. The newcomers might have good suggestions to address impact, as they've often seen such problems before. Development has been so recent that local politics have not yet been affected. However, a recent school bond issue failed, perhaps because it wasn't promoted well in this conservative county. Rapid economic development now offers jobs to recent graduates, who in the past would've left the area to find work. Long-term residents worry that they will end up paying for expensive new infrastructure, after the boom ends and temporary personnel have left. There was consideration of an expanded law enforcement facility, but it's not yet progressed. Currently they lack any facility for the mentally ill; those people are transferred by car to Pueblo. They also lack a juvenile facility, any kind of foster care, or a detoxification center. The jail lacks an exercise yard, and the crowded court docket means that inmates charged with a felony may wait for months before trial. The Sheriff anticipates another 6-8 years of growth before current mine construction is completed. Just one subdivision of mine-related housing equals 50% of Craig's population a few years ago. New churches are forming -- as are new drinking establishments. There has been rapid turnover in law enforcement personnel, statewide. He has retrained 2 women employees as jailors, who are doing well.",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1975/1977,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transMoffat,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Moffat County, CO","Craig, CO",,,,,,,,1969/1976,,,,,,,,"JZ: probable range of interview date based on pp. 2, 13; no video yet found for this transcript; 24 Mar. 2014",,,,,

They recollect the antics of mules, used in the mines long ago. They wonder about recent union activities in Trinidad and Aguilar.

Measures to suppress dust can succeed, but require investment by the owners. Compensation for affected miners is funded by the mine operators. They discuss unionization in coal mines of the West: some mines remain non-union by paying high wages and bonuses. Other union mines avoid the UMWA by organizing with operating engineers, etc. New mines are discussed, including their effects on nearby hot springs. The mines are influenced by the type of coal and by coking coal markets. Coal mining can cause a ""bump"" or ""bounce"" effect on surrounding geology. They also discuss ""long haul"" [long wall?] and continuous mining machines and other changes in mining over the last 40 years. All agreed that miners need to be trained on new equipment and that young miners need to be recruited into the union. The future of UMWA depends upon younger and non-union miners: many of these fear crime and corruption in the union. They discuss the frequent strikes earlier in their careers, without any strike benefits.",summary,,,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1978-06,Text,text/pdf,narv_coloradoCoal_transRedstone,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Colorado,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JZ: no video yet found for this transcript. 24 Mar. 2014,,,,,

Next the film is focused on a coal miner and interviewer who are discussing the UMW (United Mine Workers) strike and contract which was taking place at the time of the filming. They introduce the miner as Bill Morgan, he later says he does electrician work at the mine nearby. He discusses his observations on labor strikes and the struggle for medical and death benefits, and after some banter back and forth with some other miners walking in and around the restaurant, another coal mine worker (he mentions he is technically a carpenter) , who they call ""Pete"" enters the conversation and sits with the men. The increased productivity in the mines, and the changes that have occurred with the passage of decades is discussed briefly, then they state that despite the improvement in working conditions and pay, they still didn't pressure their children to become coal miners because they wanted a better life for them. One miner states that his oldest son worked briefly in the mine but he now teaches classes, and his youngest son became a miner, but not because he was encouraged by Bill Morgan. Both men agree that the Union hasn't had great leadership since the death of John L. Lewis. The miners do concede that years ago, they had to ""dig trench"" or ""put up fence"" to supplement the irregular hours of the mine in order to make ends meet, and the company store got all of the mining money back for the company in the form of supplies and food. ""Pete"" tells the interviewers that the ""reporting"" of the strike issues isn't complete, and the reporters tell the story that they want to tell, so no matter what the miners tell them about the truth of the labor strike, the reality of the situation is never given to the people, so the people just think about how the coal shortage is affecting them, but they don't think about what the miners to through to get them that coal.",summary,,SegmentSequence,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3/7/1978,MovingImage,video/mp4,135-Portal,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Somerset, CO","Paonia, CO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The class doubt that troops have ever been sent into a coal mine. Then follows discussion of the non-union status of a new mine (Westmoreland), where the union is picketing to seek recognition. The group doubt that the facility will unionize, as the pay and benefits are already good. There have been minor incidents of vandalism, but even the picketers have cooperated with the management to clean up afterwards. The members mention the complexity of the proposed contract, and they draw distinctions between eastern vs. western coal mines. Some youngsters complain about boredom in this small town. There are remarks about the rate of growth (22% increase in population from 1974-1978). A recent bond issue was defeated, perhaps because much of the voting population were retirees on fixed incomes and feared increased taxes. The group feel that there has been modest increase in local jobs, but not so much as in Craig or Hayden, Colorado. There has been some local resistance to growth and concern about new growth in floodplains. Conversely, some residents complain that about a lack of shops or recreation choices. The interviewer queries the audience about major mine disasters nearby: they recall that in the Somerset mine, 4 miners were killed in a cave-in in 1969. After high school most girls leave the area, while some boys stay to work in the mines. Summer work is difficult to get. They discuss the first woman miner in the area: there was initial resistance (especially from older miners who considered women in the mine as bad luck) but more acceptance now. Most of this audience wouldn't want to work that hard, under those difficult/dangerous conditions. Members discuss plans after high school graduation: most plan on college, outside the area. Many guys return to the area and work in the mines, after trying college, because of the good pay. There's mention of working as miner vs. as a ""company man"": there seems to be less strife between groups here than in more entrenched communities. There has been some migration from Crested Butte, after mines closed there. Some families were originally Yugoslav or Austrian. Residents report some resentment of the impact of large construction crews, who briefly move into an area, make a lot of demands upon it, but then leave. There are conflicts with some ""environmentalists"", but there are also legitimate, local concerns about the environmental impact of Westmoreland's mining operations. The term ""newcomers"" is used broadly here: many long-time residents are still called that. There are concerns about rapid growth in the area, demands upon a limited water supply, and the need for zoning and land regulations. Some residents voice specific concerns about ""trailer houses"".",summary,,,,,,University of Colorado Boulder Archives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3/9/1978,MovingImage,video/mp4,143-Media-Class,Colorado Coal Project Collection,English,144-Union-Meeting,relatedTo,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/5gv43p,narv_coloradoCoal_transMedia,derivedFrom,http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/s/899bt4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Paonia, CO","Delta County, CO",,,,,,,,1969/1978,,,,,,,,JZ; CAH: 35:45 to 1:03:00 is p.1-18 of transcript.,,,,,
